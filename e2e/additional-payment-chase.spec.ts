// docs/END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md row "Outstanding additional payment (#2350)".
//
// When a change pushes a paid booking's price up, the difference becomes an
// additional payment the member has to make themselves. Before #2350 nothing
// chased them for it and no admin screen showed it, so it could sit there for
// good. This walks the loop an officer actually performs: find the booking from
// the owed filter, read what is outstanding, and chase the member — then prove
// the club cannot chase the same member twice inside the hour.
//
// The owing booking is SEEDED (prisma/demo-seed.ts, id ADDITIONAL_OWED_BOOKING_ID)
// rather than produced by an admin edit here: raising a real additional payment
// mints a Stripe PaymentIntent, and this journey must run whether or not Stripe
// test-mode keys are configured. Everything downstream of that state — the list
// markers, the panel, the re-send, its email and its cooldown — is the real
// application code.
//
// Serial: the second test spends the re-send cooldown the third asserts on.
test.describe.configure({ mode: "serial" });
// Each re-send is a full mail round-trip through mailpit; the default per-test
// timeout is tight for that on a loaded CI runner.
