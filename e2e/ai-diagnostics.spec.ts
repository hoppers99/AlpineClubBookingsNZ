/**
 * AI DIAGNOSTICS, END TO END (AID-7, #2378).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: reach the provider. Diagnostics calls a paid
 * model, so no E2E here spends money, and none of them mocks the product's own
 * contracts to pretend otherwise (#2378: "E2E/screenshots use seeded data and the
 * real combined registry, not mocked product contracts").
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD, AND WHY THAT IS THE INTERESTING HALF. A demo deployment has
 * no dedicated diagnostics credential and no SELECT-only database role, so a real
 * question travels through the REAL route and is refused by a REAL gate — module,
 * rate limit, body, module flag, global backstop, metering, readiness, credential —
 * before a provider is ever contacted. The thing #2378 actually asks to be proved is
 * that the operator is then told something true and actionable rather than "AI
 * failed", and that is exactly what an unconfigured deployment exercises for free.
 *
 * So these specs prove: the tab exists only where the server granted it, the
 * stethoscope names a real seeded booking, the consent ticks start unticked and
 * reset, the refusal is the server's own copy, and it never tells anybody to reload.
