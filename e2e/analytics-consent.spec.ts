/*
  Google Analytics consent, end to end (#2573, docs/E2E_PLAYWRIGHT.md).

  This spec exists for the one guarantee a unit test can only prove
  STRUCTURALLY. The component test asserts that no `<Script>` element is
  rendered before the visitor accepts; that is good evidence, but the promise the
  owner's decision actually makes is about the NETWORK — "do not send Google
  Analytics requests, cookieless pings or consent-status data to Google before
  acceptance". Only a real browser can be asked whether anything left for
  Google's hosts, so that is what this asserts: every request to
  googletagmanager.com, google-analytics.com and analytics.google.com is
  recorded, and the expected count before Accept is zero.

  It also covers the hard cutover from the operator's side: the club starts with
  no measurement id (the seed has none, because `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
  is no longer read and its value is not imported), so the admin has to save one
  through Admin -> Integrations before anything can load at all.

  A fake measurement id is used deliberately. Google answers a 404 for an unknown
  id, which is all this spec needs: the assertion is about WHETHER a request is
  made and WHAT URL it carries, never about a response. No real property is
  touched and no measurement data is sent anywhere.

      A CONDITIONAL check on the URL sanitisation, and its limit is stated

      request follows at all — which means this loop normally has nothing to
      inspect and must not be mistaken for the proof.

      What proves the sanitisation is `analytics-route-policy.test.ts` (only
      origin + pathname is ever built, for an eligible route) and
      `analytics-consent.test.tsx` (`send_page_view: false`, one page view per

      does happen on some future runner, a query string in `dl` fails the suite
