/**
 * The pre-cutover warm-up gate against a REAL release (#2566).
 *
 * The owner's decision is explicit that unit coverage of the route list is not
 * enough: "Run production-mode integration tests against the actual target-service
 * and ISR configuration." Everything here therefore needs the staging stack, and
 * each case says what only a real server can show:
 *
 *  • the ISR verification is a genuine `x-nextjs-cache` round trip against the
 *    release's own in-memory store — a mocked fetch can only prove the rule, not
 *    that the header exists and says what the rule expects;
 *  • route discovery reads `prerender-manifest.json` and
 *    `app-path-routes-manifest.json` out of the built artifact, so this is the only
 *    place that proves those files ship in the standalone image and carry the shape
 *    the classifier reads;
 *  • the critical routes are classified from that same artifact, so a release whose
 *    render modes drifted from `CRITICAL_PUBLIC_ROUTES` fails HERE rather than in
 *    production;
 *  • the warm-up asks the release's own loopback origin from inside the container,
 *    which no unit test can observe.
 *
 * The stack is a single app service rather than a blue/green pair, which changes
 * nothing that matters: the gate always warms the container it runs in.
