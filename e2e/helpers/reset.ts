/**
 * RETRY IDEMPOTENCY HELPERS (issue #2302).
 *
 * `playwright.config.ts` sets `retries: 2` in CI. A retry re-runs the test (and,
 * for a `mode: "serial"` group, the WHOLE group) against the database the failed
 * attempt left behind — the suite prepares its seed ONCE per run, never between
 * attempts. So any spec that permanently mutates seeded state on its way to an
 * assertion turns one transient failure into three deterministic ones, and the
 * reported error becomes the pollution rather than the real cause.
 *
 * Three of the flakes in #2302 were exactly this:
 *  - `waitlist.spec.ts:57` — attempt 0 created Wanda's booking on the seeded-full
 *    window, so retries got `BOOKING_MEMBER_NIGHT_CONFLICT` where the spec
 *    asserts `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`.
 *  - `xero-setup-wizard.spec.ts:48` — attempt 0 advanced the persisted wizard
 *    cursor past step 1, so retries never saw the step-1 heading.
 *  - `stripe-payment.spec.ts:40` — attempt 0 booked the persona onto its stay
 *    window, so retries could not reach the review step at all.
 *
 * The rule these helpers exist to enforce: a spec that mutates state must make
 * its OWN setup idempotent, in a `beforeAll`/`beforeEach` that re-runs on every
 * attempt. Never a sleep, never a retry-count bump, never a loosened assertion.
 * See docs/E2E_PLAYWRIGHT.md → "Retry idempotency".

// Booking statuses this helper clears, all of which `GET /api/admin/bookings`
// can filter on:
//  - the six `POST /api/bookings/<id>/cancel` accepts, and
//  - DRAFT, which cancel REFUSES (it is not in CANCELLABLE_BOOKING_STATUSES,
//    src/lib/booking-cancel.ts) but which does hold a member night while
//    unexpired — it is in MEMBER_NIGHT_CONFLICT_BOOKING_STATUSES. A leftover
//    draft is exactly what an on-behalf/wizard attempt that died before payment
//    leaves behind, so it is cleared through the product's own admin delete
//    (`DELETE /api/bookings/<id>` hard-deletes a draft for an ADMIN actor —
//    src/lib/booking-delete.ts) rather than silently missed.
//
// Known blind spots, none of them reachable from the specs that call this today,
// all of them now VISIBLE rather than silent (the post-condition below re-lists
// and fails if anything it can see survives):
//  - AWAITING_REVIEW: cancellable, but absent from the list route's
//    VALID_STATUSES, so it cannot be listed here at all. Whole-lodge requests are
//    the only source and that spec does its own cleanup.
//  - COMPLETED: holds a member night and is listable, but nothing can cancel it.
//    Only the completion sweep produces it, and CRON_ENABLED is off in the E2E
//    stack.
//  - Ownership: the list route reports `memberName` for the booking OWNER only
//    (it returns no guest names), so a leftover where this member is a GUEST on
//    someone else's booking cannot be matched. Every caller here books the
//    member as the owner.

/**
 * Clears every live booking a named member OWNS that checks in on one of the

 * (src/lib/booking-member-night-conflicts.ts) and outside the capacity-holding
 * set, so cancelling restores the pre-attempt invariant for every status the
 * cancel route accepts; a DRAFT, which it refuses, is hard-deleted instead.
 *
 * Both effects are then VERIFIED: the same query is re-run and must come back
 * empty. A silent no-op — a filter that no longer matches the response shape, a
 * status nothing here can clear — would otherwise degrade into exactly the
 * retry pollution this helper exists to prevent, and would do it invisibly.
 *

 * database access is introduced into the Playwright process, and no test-only
 * endpoint is added.

 * @param adminRequest an ADMIN-authenticated request context. Full admin, for
 *   three reasons: the cancel route's `notifyMember` opt-out is
 *   booking-management-admin only; the started-stay block (#2029) is waived for
 *   ADMIN, which a leftover shifted into the past needs; and only an admin may
 *   delete another member's draft.
 * @param checkIn one check-in date, or several (a spec whose booking MOVES can
 *   leave it on any of the dates it moves through).

 * second ACTIVE policy sharing a (scope, name) pair with 409
 * `POLICY_NAME_CONFLICT` (#2363,

 * how run 30772673366 turned one real failure into three — both retries died in
 * setup, on the conflict, instead of re-running the behaviour.
 *
 * Two details of the route this drives are easy to get wrong, and both are the
 * reason this lives here rather than in each spec:
 *  - DELETE is a DEACTIVATE (`active: false`), and the create's conflict check is
 *    ACTIVE-only, so deactivating is enough to free the name.
 *  - DELETE REQUIRES the row's `version` in the body. A bodyless call throws on
 *    `request.json()`, answers 500, and leaves the policy active — silently, if
 *    the caller ignores the status.
 * Hence the version, the asserted status, and the verified post-condition.
 *
 * @param adminRequest an ADMIN-authenticated request context (`bookings:edit`).
 * @param namePrefix the spec's own policy-name prefix. Matching on a prefix, not
 *   equality, is what lets a spec give each ATTEMPT its own policy name and still
 *   have one call clear every attempt's leftovers.
 * @param lodgeId the partition to clear: a lodge id for that lodge's override
 *   set, omitted for the club-wide set. The list route matches the partition
 *   EXACTLY — never null-tolerant — so the two are cleared independently.
