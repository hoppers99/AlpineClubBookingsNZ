 *
 * Direct database access is the exception in this suite — every other spec
 * drives the app over HTTP — and it is unavoidable here rather than convenient:
 * `saveClubTheme()` resolves `completedAt` as `existing?.completedAt ?? …`, so
 * the app can COMPLETE setup and can never un-complete it. There is no admin
 * route, and deliberately so. Measuring the pre-setup wire behaviour therefore
 * needs either a second differently-seeded stack or this; see the spec header.
 *
 * `E2E_DATABASE_URL` is exported by `scripts/e2e-stack.sh`. Absent, this throws
 * with the reason rather than silently connecting somewhere else.
