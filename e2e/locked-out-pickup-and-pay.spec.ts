/**
 * #2779 — a subscription-locked member picks up and pays a booking an admin made
 * on their behalf.
 *
 * WHY THIS SPEC EXISTS. #2779 was filed as an enforcement gap: under the
 * platform-default HARD_BLOCK lockout, a member with an unpaid subscription
 * cannot confirm a FREE draft but CAN confirm a priced one by paying for it. The
 * owner ruled (11 Aug 2026) that the asymmetry is deliberate and load-bearing —
 * it is the only way the club can make a booking for a member whose subscription
 * is in arrears and have that member complete it themselves:
 *
 *   > We need a way where a locked out member due to subscription can have an
 *   > admin "book on behalf" booking made and then the member logs in and picks
 *   > up the pending booking and pays it.
 *
 * So the payment path staying ungated is a FEATURE (`INV-LOCKOUT-069`), and this
 * spec is the standing proof that the journey it enables actually completes.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT BE A UNIT TEST. Three things only the running app can show, and
 * each is a way the journey has failed for a real member without any unit test
 * going red:
 *
 *  1. THE MEMBER IS GENUINELY LOCKED OUT while paying. Unit tests mock the
 *     lockout mode and the subscription row. Here the club's real setting is
 *     saved through the real admin panel API, the member's subscription is
 *     really unpaid in the database, and the SAME member is refused their own
 *     booking seconds before the payment path admits them.
 *  2. THE PATH IS FINDABLE. A journey that works only if you already know the
 *     booking's URL is not a journey. The member's dashboard must surface the
 *     draft, say the club saved it, and lead to a working pay control.
 *  3. THE TWO GATES COMPOSE. Create-on-behalf, discovery, and pay each pass on
 *     their own today; nothing but a whole run proves that the booking one
 *     produced is the booking the next one admits.
 *
 * SELF-RESTORING. The lockout mode and the Xero module are club-wide settings
 * every other spec's bookings run through, so both are snapshotted in
 * `beforeAll` and put back in `afterAll` whatever happens. The Xero module has to
 * be ON for the lockout to bite at all — subscriptions are invoiced through Xero,
 * so `resolveSubscriptionLockoutMode` answers NO_BLOCK while the module is off.
 *
 * WINDOW: base index 28 — attempts land on 28 / 44 / 60.
 *
 * Base 10 was WRONG and is the kind of wrong that hides: it is already
 * `COMPLIANT_WINDOW_INDEX` in `member-policy-exception-requests.spec.ts`, and its
 * retry-1 index 26 is also reached by `multi-lodge/policy-exception-second-lodge.spec.ts`
 * (`stayWindow(25 + retry)`). One worker and `fullyParallel: false` keep the two
 * specs from ever running together, and they book different members, so nothing
 * failed — but this spec can leave a PAID/CONFIRMED booking on those nights when
 * Stripe test keys are configured, and #1703 / #2625 are both collisions that
 * were "harmless" until they were not.
 *
 * 28 / 44 / 60 is no longer a hand-checked claim: it is asserted by
 * `src/lib/__tests__/e2e-stay-window-disjointness.test.ts`, which parses every
 * spec's window calls (including the `n + retry * k` shapes), fails on any
 * collision with this band, and fails if this very comment stops matching the
 * code. Move the base index and that test tells you what is free.
 *
 * The MAX_MONTH_HOPS ceiling documented on `RETRY_WINDOW_STRIDE` does not bind
 * here: this spec never clicks the booking calendar — it creates every booking
 * over the API and opens pages by URL — so a far-out window costs no navigation.
 * `stayWindow` still throws loudly if index 60 ever falls outside the seeded
 * seasons.
 *
 * STRIPE: the final card charge is skipped unless real test-mode keys are
 * configured, exactly as `stripe-payment.spec.ts` does. Everything that #2779 is
 * ABOUT — the refusal, the on-behalf create, the discovery, and the payment path
 * ADMITTING this member and moving the booking to PAYMENT_PENDING — runs
 * unconditionally, because none of it needs a provider.
