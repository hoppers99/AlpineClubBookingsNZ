  #2307 (epic #2305) — the member-guest consent journey, browser end to end.

  Matrix rows (docs/END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md): the two Playwright rows the
  MG2 server half recorded as landing with the visible surfaces —
    - approve: a cross-family add persists PENDING, the target answers Yes on
      the booking page's consent card, and the guest list then shows the
      Consented badge;
    - decline on an unpaid booking: the target answers No, the held place is
      released, and the booker's guest list no longer names them.
  Plus the delegate-route privacy edge worth proving against real rows: a
  signed-in member who is NOT the target's family delegate — including the
  BOOKER, who knows more about this booking than anyone — gets one neutral
  "nothing here" page from /bookings/consent/<guestId>, with no booking facts
  on it, indistinguishable from a made-up id.

  MECHANICS:
    - Wanda (WAITLISTER) books; Nadia (NOMINATOR_TWO) is the cross-family
      target. Both are seeded PAID with complete, self-confirmed profiles —
      required, because a cross-family add refuses an unpaid or incomplete
      target (D-8) — and both hold logins, so the consent-request email goes
      to Nadia directly and she answers for herself on the booking page.
    - Windows 13 and 14: 0–9 are the other specs', 11–12 the whole-lodge
      spec's. Fresh windows keep Nadia clear of the person-night guard.
    - The memberGuests module is switched on for this file and the previous
      module settings restored afterwards.
    - RETRY-SAFE by construction: every attempt books its OWN stay windows
      (see approveWindow/declineWindow). CI retries this file up to twice, and
      a retry reusing attempt one's nights would be refused — the PENDING row
      attempt one created still holds Nadia's person-night, and that refusal
      is collapsed to D-8's neutral 403, so the retry would fail on the
      fixture rather than on the behaviour under test.
*/

test.describe.configure({ mode: "serial" });

// A WINDOW PER ATTEMPT, not a fixed pair. Attempt 1 leaves real rows behind —
// a PENDING member guest holds a bed and a person-night (D-4) until the nightly
// sweep expires it — so a retry booking the same nights for the same target
// hits the member-night guard and gets D-8's neutral 403, failing on the
// fixture rather than on the behaviour. Indices 0-9 belong to the other specs
// and 11-12 to the whole-lodge spec; 13-18 are this file's, three attempts x
// two tests.
