  #2308 (epic #2305, MG3) — finding another member to add as a guest, end to end.

  Matrix row (docs/END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md, "Booking privacy + enumeration"):
  one journey per find mode plus a module-OFF assertion.

  WHY THIS SPEC IS DELIBERATELY API-HEAVY, with only the surface checked in the
  browser. What MG3 has to be right about is a privacy envelope — which statuses
  come back, which fields a row carries, which route exists — and those are
  claims about RESPONSES, not about pixels. Driving them through the wizard would
  test the wizard's debounce far more than it tested the envelope, and would make
  the spec's failures ambiguous exactly where its assertions need to be sharp.
  What genuinely IS visual — does the button appear, is the panel inline rather
  than a dialog, does the whole surface disappear when the club has the module
  off — is checked in the browser, in the LAST describe, for the reason set out
  above it.

  MECHANICS:
    - Wanda (WAITLISTER) is the signed-in booker doing the finding. Nadia
      (NOMINATOR_TWO) is a member outside Wanda's family group, which is what
      makes her the interesting target.
    - NO BOOKING IS CREATED. The browser walk stops at the guests step, so this
      spec claims no capacity and leaves no person-night behind for its own retry
      to trip over; the calendar clicks use a spare stay window so they cannot
      collide with another spec's nights either.
    - The memberGuests module and the two search settings are driven through
      their admin routes and restored afterwards.

  THE BROWSER ASSERTIONS RUN LAST, DELIBERATELY.

  This file is serial, so the first failure skips everything after it — and the

  mistake in it silently took every privacy assertion in the file with it (the
  spec contributed nothing at all, while the PR body still claimed the
  properties). The API assertions are the ones that carry the privacy claims and
  they are cheap and deterministic, so they go first; anything that has to drive
