  #2309 (epic #2305, MG4) — adding a member guest while EDITING a booking, and
  the officer doing the same thing on somebody else's booking.

  Matrix row (docs/END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md): "Booking guests on the edit and
  admin paths".

  WHY THIS FILE IS IN THE MULTI-LODGE PROJECT rather than beside the other two
  member-guest specs. The edit path reaches capacity, pricing and the guest
  plan through the modification service, and every one of those is lodge-scoped.
  Running it in the matrix means the section, the add and the notification are
  proved on a club that has more than one lodge — which is where a booking's own
  lodge silently becoming "the default lodge" would show up.

  WHAT IT PROVES, in order:
    1. A member who has ALREADY made a booking can add a cross-family member
       guest from the edit panel — the whole point of MG4, since before it the
       only way was to cancel and rebook.
    2. The Guests card header carries the signed-off TWO-BUTTON shape (owner
       sign-off, 1 Aug 2026) — "+ Add Member Guest" then
       "+ Add Non-Member Guest" — mirroring the wizard, and the pre-save preview
       is honest: the new row says the person will be emailed and asked, and
       their bed held, BEFORE anything is saved.
    3. Saving actually asks them — the consent request lands in Mailpit.
    4. An OFFICER adding on the same booking gets the other rule: the member is
       added immediately and TOLD, not asked, and the mail says so.

  MECHANICS, mirroring member-guest-consent.spec.ts because the constraints are
  the same:
    - Wanda (WAITLISTER) books; Nadia (NOMINATOR_TWO) is the cross-family
      target. Both are seeded PAID with complete, self-confirmed profiles — a
      cross-family add refuses an unpaid or incomplete target under D-8 — and
      both hold logins, so the mail goes to them directly.
    - Bianca (ROLE_PERSONAS.ADMIN_BOOKINGS) is the Booking Officer. She is the
      persona #1376 exists for, which is exactly why she is the one used here:
      the admin section must work for her through the exact-email box even if
      her role carries no membership access.
    - A WINDOW PER ATTEMPT. Attempt 1 leaves a real PENDING row holding Nadia's
      person-night (D-4), so a retry on the same nights would be refused by the
      member-night guard and collapsed to D-8's neutral 403 — failing on the
      fixture rather than on the behaviour. Indices 0-9 belong to other specs,
      11-12 to the whole-lodge spec and 13-18 to the consent spec; 19-24 are
      this file's, three attempts x two tests.
