/**
 * Multi-lodge coverage for TLR-8C (#2526): a booking-policy exception is decided
 * and EXECUTED at the lodge it was frozen against.
 *
 * The failure this exists to catch is a lodge leak — a rule configured for one
 * lodge stopping bookings at another, or an approval creating the booking at the
 * club's default lodge because that is what a missing `lodgeId` falls back to.
 * The proposal freezes its lodge, and the approval's capacity recheck and
 * canonical create must both use THAT lodge.
 *
 * Runs only in the `multi-lodge` project (E2E_MULTI_LODGE=1), which has no auth
 * setup dependency, so both actors log in for themselves.
 *
 * Retry idempotency (#2302, docs/E2E_PLAYWRIGHT.md): every attempt takes its own
 * stay window and its own policy NAME, and clears both before it starts. Stay
 * indices 0-9 belong to other specs, 11-12 to the whole-lodge spec, 13-18 to the
 * consent spec and 19-24 to the member-guest edit spec; 25-27 are this file's,
 * one per attempt.
