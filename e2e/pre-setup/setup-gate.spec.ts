/**
 * The pre-setup gate ON THE WIRE (#2420, review finding F5).
 *
 * The unit suite calls the exported `proxy()` and asserts on the `NextResponse`
 * it returns — which is exactly the layer at which this whole class of bug LOOKS
 * fine. `NextResponse.rewrite(url, { status: 503 })` also carries `status: 503`
 * on the object and still answers 200 on the wire, because Next only propagates
 * a middleware status on the direct-response branch. Nothing but a real server
 * can tell those apart, so this spec exists to read the status line itself.
 *
 * ## Why this runs against the SAME stack, not a second one
 *
 * Every stack `scripts/e2e-stack.sh` builds is seeded `SEED_THEME_COMPLETE=1`,
 * so pre-setup was unmeasured. A second stack seeded without the flag was the
 * obvious answer and was rejected: it means another `docker compose up --build`,
 * another Postgres, another seed and another ~15-minute CI job, for four
 * assertions — and it would need a new required check added to branch
 * protection, which is not something this branch can do.
 *
 * Instead this is a project of its own that runs LAST (`dependencies:
 * ["chromium"]` in playwright.config.ts), flips the one row that decides the
 * state, and puts it back. Two things make that safe rather than reckless:
 * `workers: 1` and `fullyParallel: false`, so nothing else is in flight while
 * the site is closed; and it is the last thing to run, so even a failed restore
 * cannot affect another spec. The restore is still in `afterAll`, and the first
 * test of the run re-asserts the site is open, so a leaked state is loud.
 *
 * The state change is made directly against the database because the
 * application genuinely cannot make it: `saveClubTheme()` never clears
 * `completedAt`. See `e2e/helpers/setup-state.ts`.
