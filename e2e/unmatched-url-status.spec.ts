// raises notFound(); only a real server can show what status that puts on the
// wire, which is the thing the issue was actually about — a soft 404 tells
// search engines a dead address is real content and tells monitoring that a
// missing page is a working one.
//
// Anonymous on purpose: these are the shapes a crawler or a vulnerability
// scanner asks for, so no login is used.
//
// This stack is seeded with SEED_THEME_COMPLETE=1 (.github/workflows/e2e.yml),
// so it renders the real public site. That matters here: without it
// (website)/layout.tsx serves its "Site setup in progress" holding screen
// INSTEAD of the page, the page's notFound() never runs, and every URL below
// would answer 200. Measuring a stack that lacked the flag is how #2405 came to
// report a soft 404 that a configured club does not have.
