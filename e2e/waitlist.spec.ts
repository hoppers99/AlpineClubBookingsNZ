// High row (docs/END_TO_END_TEST_MATRIX.md): "Waitlist, offer expiry,
// force-confirm, bump/cancel."
//
// Coverage and the deliberate gaps:
//  - Placement: Wanda books a seeded-full September window. The wizard's own
//    client capacity pre-check blocks a KNOWN-full night before its in-wizard
//    waitlist prompt (which only fires on a submit-time race), so placement is
//    driven through the same endpoint the wizard calls after a 409
//    (POST /api/bookings { waitlist: true }) — the faithful server path.
//  - Admin force-confirm: the only admin waitlist mutation, driven through the
//    /admin/waitlist UI (overbook branch, since the night is full).
//  - Member accept offer: a seeded, non-expired WAITLIST_OFFERED booking is
//    accepted through the member offer card.
//  - Offer creation + expiry run ONLY on the in-process scheduler
//    (src/lib/cron-waitlist.ts via instrumentation.node.ts; CRON_ENABLED is off
//    in staging and there is no HTTP waitlist-cron endpoint), so those are not
//    browser-reachable — the offer/expiry STATE is asserted via the admin UI on
//    the seeded (expired) offer instead.
//
// Wanda (not alice) drives this: she is seeded PAID with a complete, confirmed
// profile, so the booking API accepts her without the member-details gate.
//
// RETRY SHAPE (#2302). Only the first two tests are a single story (test 2
// force-confirms the booking test 1 creates), so ONLY THEY are `mode: "serial"`,
// and their shared `beforeAll` restores the pre-attempt database state. The last
// two read seeded fixtures and depend on nothing above them, so they stay
// independent tests: a failure in either retries that test alone and can never
// drag the placement pair back through a database it has already mutated. That
// pairing — narrow serial groups plus an idempotent group `beforeAll` — is the
// rule for this suite; see e2e/helpers/reset.ts and docs/E2E_PLAYWRIGHT.md.
