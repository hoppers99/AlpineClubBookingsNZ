/**
 * #2668 review. The built-in restore was the one converted surface with NO
 * behavioural suite: its copy was held up by the tree-walking source contract
 * alone, and that walk is a source scan with known blind spots. A regression
 * that moved the sentence out of the branch — or reintroduced the old claim
 * through a value the scan cannot follow — would have shipped.
 *
 * It is also the surface whose message makes an extra promise: "Restoring again
 * is safe." That promise is the server's (`ensureBuiltInDisplays` upserts each
 * reserved key back to its shipped definition, pinned by
 * `lodge-display-built-in-seeds` and `admin-display-built-ins-restore`), and
 * what the CLIENT owes it is that a retry is actually possible and is the same
 * request — not a second, different write.
