// (already large) page takes a small diff — #2248 rewrites it next — and so the
// empty-state reasoning can be unit-tested on its own.
//
// The built-in boards are created ONLY by the database seed, and no deploy or
// upgrade path re-runs the seed, so a club whose database predates the
// lobby-display feature has no built-in rows at all: the gallery is empty, says
// nothing, and offers no way out. This is the way out.

/**
 * Why the templates list is empty, as far as the BROWSER can honestly tell.
 *
 * The causes are told apart by the status the templates GET returns, because
 * that response is the only evidence this page has:
 *  • `unreachable` — the fetch itself failed, so there is no status. Without
 *    this the page sat on "Loading…" for ever, which is the very blank screen
 *    this issue exists to remove.
 *  • `signed-out` — 401. The session expired under an open tab; nothing is
 *    wrong with the data or with the role.
 *  • `forbidden` — 403 from the route's `lodge:view` guard. The browser is told
 *    only that the request was refused, never WHICH permission was missing, so
 *    the copy names the likely cause and says how it was inferred instead of
 *    asserting a role state it cannot read.
 *  • `module-off` — 404. The proxy 404s all of `/api/admin/display/*` while the
 *    `lobbyDisplay` module is off (and it is off by default). Normally the PAGE
 *    404s with it, so reaching this state means the flag went off under an
 *    already-open tab. The copy says "looks switched off" rather than asserting
 *    it, because a 404 is also what a genuinely missing route would return.
 *  • `loaded` — the list came back fine. If it is ALSO empty, that is the
 *    never-seeded case the restore action fixes.
 *  • `error` — anything else, named as unknown rather than blamed on a guess.
