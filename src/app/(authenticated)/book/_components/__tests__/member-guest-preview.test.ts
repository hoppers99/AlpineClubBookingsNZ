// MG3 (#2308) — the wizard's consent PREVIEW, and the family-scope trap.

// prediction. The prediction has one non-obvious case that is easy to get wrong:
// D-9 makes any active member resolvable by email, INCLUDING the booker's own
// family, so the finder can perfectly well produce a family-scope add — which is
// consent-free (D-6) and must carry no badge at all.
