 * Read the lockout regime off a `GET /api/member/subscription-status` response

 *
 * WHY THIS VALIDATES RATHER THAN CASTS: the same unpaid subscription means three
 * different things to a member depending on the club's mode, and the wizard
 * banner has to pick one sentence. Under HARD_BLOCK they cannot book; under
 * NON_MEMBER_PRICING they can, at non-member rates; under NO_BLOCK the
 * subscription does not gate booking at all. An unrecognised or absent mode —
 * an older cached response predating the field — resolves to HARD_BLOCK, the
 * migration-safe server default, so a stale response can never silently drop a
 * warning that is still true. Failing the other way would tell a locked-out
 * member they may book.
 *
 * `memberRateNotice` is the server's sentence and is passed through untouched;
 * anything that is not a non-empty string becomes null, and the banner then
 * simply omits the explanation rather than inventing one.
