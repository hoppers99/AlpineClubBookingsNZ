/**
 * The signed-out branch's sign-in affordance is a plain, tokenless `/login`
 * anchor (#2827) carrying a tokenless tab-binding nonce (#2974).
 *
 * It used to be `buildLoginPath('/family-invite/<token>')`, which put the invite
 * token into an `href` — and from there into the visitor's address bar, their
 * history and any `Referer` the next hop saw. Do not reintroduce a callbackUrl
 * here, in any attribute, hidden input or form action.
 *
 * **What IS in the anchor, since #2974, is `?inviteReturn=<nonce>`** — 128 random
 * bits minted by `src/proxy.ts` on this very response and handed to this render in
 * {@link FAMILY_INVITE_RETURN_NONCE_HEADER}. It is not derived from the token and
 * it is worth nothing on its own: it only unlocks a landing for a browser that
 * already holds the matching `HttpOnly` cookie. Its job is to make the return
 * address belong to THIS TAB, so the next person to sign in on a shared kiosk
 * browser is not landed on somebody else's invitation. Absent header (an old
 * browser, a soft navigation, a signed-in visitor) simply yields a plain `/login`
 * and the ordinary post-login landing.
 *
 * **What that link did NOT expose, corrected 20 Aug 2026.** The first cut of this
 * fix recorded that this page injects admin-authored Raw CSS and that
 * `a[href^="/family-invite/9f"]` therefore read the token out a character at a
 * time. That is false: `(public)/layout.tsx` injects `theme.appCss`, which
 * `buildClubThemeAppCss()` builds **without** `rawCss`, so no admin CSS selector
 * ever ran on this page. The oracle is real on `(website-dynamic)`, which is where
 * #2827's other two fixes live. Keeping the token out of this link is still right —
 * the URL exposure was real, and a future move of this group under the shared
 * chrome would make the CSS oracle real too — but it is defence in depth here, not
 * a closed breach. Full account in `src/lib/family-invite-return-address.ts`.
 *
 * The post-login return address is carried server-side instead, in the HttpOnly
 * cookie that module documents: `src/proxy.ts` writes it on a signed-out
 * navigation to this page and retires it on the signed-in GET, and all four
 * post-login landing sites honour it for the tab that presents the nonce.
 *
 * **Nothing on this page needs JavaScript to arm the return address** — the
 * affordance is an ordinary server-rendered anchor, and both halves of the
 * binding (the cookie and the nonce in that anchor) ride on the HTTP response
 * that rendered it. That is the property a Server Action carrier would have cost,
 * and it is why one was rejected in #2827. It is a claim about *this page*, not
 * about the whole sign-in: `LoginForm` submits through `signIn()` and so needs
 * scripting, exactly as it did before either issue.
 *
 * The wrong-account branch is NOT a `/login` link: see
 * {@link SignOutAndReturnButton}, because `/login` redirects a signed-in visitor
 * straight back here.
 *
 * An absent or expired cookie, or a sign-in started in another tab, degrades to
 * the member's ordinary post-login landing, never to an error; the emailed invite
 * link still works.
