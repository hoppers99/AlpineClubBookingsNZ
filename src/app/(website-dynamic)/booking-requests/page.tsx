/**
 * The public booking-request page: a database-backed built-in CMS page with the
 * same makeup as `/join/apply` — a code-backed route that renders its
 * `/booking-requests` PageContent row through the token pipeline. Its seeded body
 * is `{{booking-requests}}`, which renders the request-to-book form.
 *
 * ## Why it sits in `(website-dynamic)` rather than `(website)` (#2818 decision 2)
 *
 * Everything about the page says fixed-nonce group: it is CMS-backed, its content
 * is twice-sanitised admin HTML, and it sits beside `/contact` and `/join/apply`
 * in the admin's Page Content list. It is here anyway for two reasons. D1's
 * fixed-nonce census is an owner decision pinned at five addresses, and widening
 * it is a decision about the CSP rather than a routing detail. And this is one of
 * the two pages where an anonymous visitor types the most personal information,
 * so the unguessable per-request nonce is worth more here than a stored copy of a
 * form that is `force-dynamic` regardless.
 *
 * The consequences of that placement are all deliberate: no Google Analytics
 * (decision 3), no warm-up declaration (decision 4), and the pre-setup holding
 * screen in front of it exactly as before.
 *
 * `force-dynamic` is declared here as well as on the group layout, because each
 * route in this group is per-request for a permanent reason of its own and the
 * reason belongs next to the route (`check-website-render-modes.mjs` requires
 * both).
 *
 * The two tokenised confirmation flows — `respond/[token]` and `verify/[token]` —
 * are siblings under this same directory; their URLs are unchanged.
 *
 * ## Advertising this page is OPT-IN, and one field decides both halves
 *
 * The seeded row carries an EMPTY `menuTitle`, so out of the box the page keeps
 * the unlisted behaviour #2421 established: reachable by its address and by the
 * links the club already sends, absent from the navigation, and `noindex`. A club
 * that wants the form advertised types a menu title under Site Appearance &
 * Content → Page Content, and that one edit both adds the nav entry
 * (`listWebsiteMenuPages`) and makes the page indexable ({@link generateMetadata}
 * below). Reading the SAME field in both places is the point: a nav-listed page a
 * search engine is told to ignore, or an indexable page the site itself will not
 * link to, are both states nobody chose (#2818 decision 1).
