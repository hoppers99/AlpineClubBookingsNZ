/**
 * Status codes for URLs nothing serves (#2405).
 *
 * The issue reported a soft 404: unmatched URLs answering `200 OK` while
 * showing the "page not found" screen, so search engines index dead addresses
 * and monitoring cannot tell a missing page from a working one. Two things came
 * out of measuring it, and both are pinned here.
 *
 * 1. The PAGE class was already right. `(website)/[...slug]` claims every
 *    human-plausible mistyped or bot-probed URL and calls `notFound()`; Next's
 *    `HTTPAccessFallbackBoundary` catches that during the render and sets 404.
 *    The reported 200s came from a staging stack that had never completed
 *    site-style setup — see the layout note below. These cases stop the
 *    `notFound()` calls being deleted or narrowed.
 * 2. The API class was wrong, in every configuration. `/api/<anything>` that no
 *    handler claimed fell through to that same CMS PAGE catch-all, so a JSON
 *    client was handed ~23KB of `text/html`. `api/[[...unmatched]]/route.ts` now
 *    terminates those URLs with JSON, bare `/api` included.
 *
 * The "still 200" cases are as load-bearing as the 404s: a change that 404s a
 * published page, or that swallows a real API route, is far worse than the bug.
 *
 * The PRE-SETUP state is pinned here too. On a club whose `ClubTheme.completedAt`
 * is NULL the layout answers with its holding screen rather than the page, and
 * this route deliberately does not raise the miss in that state — a 404 from
 * `generateMetadata()` escapes the layout (the root not-found boundary sits
 * above it), so misses would 404 while published pages still rendered the
 * holding screen, and an anonymous visitor could read off an unlaunched site's
 * page list. #2420 has since answered the wider question by putting a 503 gate
 * in `src/proxy.ts` ahead of the render; these cases stay because the shapes
 * that skip the proxy matcher (RSC prefetches) still reach this route, and the
 * oracle must not open for them either.

/**
 * The pre-setup state at the ROUTE level, asserted so it stays uniform (#2405
 * security review).
 *
 * With `ClubTheme.completedAt` NULL, `(website)/layout.tsx` returns its "Site
 * setup in progress" screen instead of `{children}`: the page component never
 * runs, and misses and real pages are answered identically. A `notFound()` from
 * `generateMetadata()` would break out of that — the root not-found boundary
 * sits ABOVE the layout — so unknown paths would answer 404 while published
 * pages still rendered the holding screen. That difference is an enumeration
 * oracle: an anonymous visitor could walk an unlaunched club's site and learn
 * exactly which pages exist, and the 404 body would serve database-backed
 * content the club has not published yet.
 *
 * #2420 answered the wider "what should an unconfigured site say" question in
 * the proxy — 503 with the holding screen, before the render — so an ordinary
 * document request no longer reaches this code pre-setup at all. That did NOT
 * make these cases redundant, and its review round made them stricter.
 *
 * Stricter how: the guard used to consult the setup state only INSIDE
 * `if (!page)`, and that half-measure was the same oracle inverted. Pre-setup a
 * miss returned the bare club name while a HIT still returned the page's own
 * title and header text — and a request reaches this code by carrying
 * `Purpose: prefetch`, an ordinary header anyone can set, which the proxy
 * matcher skips. Suppressing `{children}` in the layout does not help, because
 * next@16.2.11 builds the document head as a separate flight slot from the
 * page's seed data, so metadata is produced even when the component never runs.
 *
 * The property is therefore UNIFORMITY, not "misses are hidden": pre-setup,
 * hit, miss and unpublished must be indistinguishable. Full coverage of that
 * across every `(website)` page lives in
 * `src/lib/__tests__/website-metadata-setup-gate.test.ts`; the status contract
 * lives in `src/lib/__tests__/setup-gate.test.ts`.
