/**
 * Contract for #2819 (and #2818 decision 6): on every code-backed public hero,
 * the only value that may reach an HTML sink is the stored CMS header field —
 * admin HTML, sanitised on write and again on read. The sentence each page
 * COMPOSES for the empty-or-missing-row branch interpolates club identity, which
 * is free settings text no sanitiser has ever seen, so it must stay an escaped
 * React text child.
 *
 * The rendered-DOM suites — `website-page-header-fallback-render.test.tsx` and
 * `booking-request-pages-fallback-render.test.tsx` — pin the behaviour, and on
 * four of the five pages a restored sink is caught there by the live element the
 * markup-shaped club identity would create. `/contact` is the exception, and it
 * is why this file exists: its fallback interpolates nothing, so a restored sink
 * emits DOM identical apart from the element tag, and no escaping assertion can
 * see it. Leaving that page's only protection a `tagName` check plus a
 * hand-maintained "this page interpolates identity" flag meant two innocent edits
 * could reopen the #2819 hole with the whole suite green.
 *
 * Matching is mostly on the SINK EXPRESSION — the source text after the `__html`
 * property key — rather than on a bare substring, so prose may discuss either
 * identifier. Two checks are deliberate exceptions and do match source text: the
 * composed sentence must appear in JSX CHILD position and must never appear in
 * JSX PROP position. A comment that spells out `text={fallbackHeaderText}` will
 * therefore fail this contract — write that example without the braces.
