/**
 * Advisory, ADMIN-ONLY pre-approval availability + conflict preview for a
 * whole-lodge booking request (#2263), mirroring the existing `link-conflicts`
 * advisory route pattern.
 *
 * What it answers, for the officer only: how full each requested night already
 * is, which nights are already exclusively held, which capacity-holding bookings
 * overlap the request, and which overridden-but-not-yet-holding bookings will
 * settle onto those nights later (#177).
 *
 * It NEVER blocks: ADR-001 decision 1 says an exclusive hold is granted
 * regardless of existing overlaps, and the officer resolves them by hand. This
 * only makes the clash visible before they press Approve.
 *
 * This is the single largest concentration of occupancy data in the whole
 * #2263 feature, and it is why the route lives under /api/admin/ behind
 * requireAdmin: a member must never learn that a night is held or full for a
 * reason other than their own booking (ADR-001 decision 6). No member surface
 * calls it and the route-boundary matrix asserts the admin guard.
