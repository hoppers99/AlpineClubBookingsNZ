/**
 * POST /api/admin/bookings/[id]/additional-payment-reminder — re-send the email
 * asking the member to pay an extra amount a booking change added (#2350).
 *
 * Authorisation mirrors the sibling admin booking actions (no-emails,
 * capacity-hold, exclusive-hold): `bookings:edit`, and any other caller gets a
 * 403 from `requireAdmin`. The route changes nothing about the booking or the
 * amount owed — it only sends the message again — and it is audited like the
 * rest of them. It carries no request-rate limiter (no sibling admin booking
 * route does): what stops it being used to pester a member is the 60-minute
 * cooldown enforced inside the service by a guarded claim, which a burst of
 * concurrent requests cannot get past.
 *
 * Refusals are deliberately specific rather than a blanket 400, because each one
 * means something different to the officer looking at the screen: 409 nothing is
 * owed / the booking is not in a collectable state / it is silenced or deleted /
 * the amount changed under them, 422 the mailer withheld the message (a
 * suppressed or placeholder address), 429 the member was already emailed inside
 * the cooldown, 502 the mail transport failed and the stamp was handed back.
