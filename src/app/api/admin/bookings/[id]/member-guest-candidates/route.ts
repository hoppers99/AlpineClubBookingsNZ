/**
 * The ADMIN member-pick surface for "+ Add Member Guest" (epic #2305, MG4
 * #2309, owner decisions D-20 and O-4).
 *
 * ONE ROUTE, BOTH MODES, because that is what the shared find panel sends: it
 * classifies what the officer typed and asks for either an exact email or a name
 * fragment. Splitting them would mean two admin routes with one audience and one
 * gate between them.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TWO METHODS, AND WHICH ONE EACH MODE USES IS LOAD-BEARING
 *
 * The email mode is a **POST**, exactly like its member-facing twin
 * `POST /api/members/guest-candidates/resolve`, and for the reason that route's
 * own docblock states without hedging: a GET puts another member's email address
 * into the request URL, and from there into the access log, the browser history,
 * the `Referer` header of anything the page subsequently loads, and every proxy
 * in between. None of that is less true because an officer typed it — if
 * anything it is worse, since an officer types many addresses in a session and
 * an admin browser is likelier to be shared. It shipped as a GET here and the
 * privacy review caught it; the method is now the same on both paths.
 *
 * The name mode stays a **GET**. A name fragment is not a contact detail, and
 * the member-facing search route is a GET for the same reason.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN REUSING THE MEMBER ROUTES
 *
 * The member finder is gated on the club's two privacy settings: name search is
 * off unless a club turns it on, and minors are excluded unless a club opts them
 * in. Owner decision D-20 says the ADMIN picker is bound by neither, and the
 * reasoning is worth stating because the opposite looks safer and is not: an
 * admin holding `membership:view` can already browse the entire membership,
 * minors included, from `/admin/members`. Gating their booking-side picker on a
 * MEMBER-FACING privacy switch protects nobody — it only makes an officer leave
 * the booking, look the member up on another page, come back and paste an
 * address. The setting exists to decide what MEMBERS can see. It is not an
 * access-control mechanism and must not be pressed into service as one, because
 * a club that later turns name search ON would then have no way to say
 * "browsable to officers, not to members" — the two would be one switch.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE TWO RIDERS, AND THEY ARE NOT OPTIONAL
 *
 * (a) NAME SEARCH IS GATED ON `membership:view`, NOT ON `bookings:edit`. #1376
 *     exists for one persona: a Booking Officer whose role deliberately does NOT
 *     carry membership access, so they can run bookings without the club's
 *     member directory. Handing that person a name type-ahead over the whole
 *     roll from inside a booking would undo #1376 completely, through a door
 *     nobody thought to look at. So a `membership:view`-less officer gets a 404
 *     on the name mode — the same answer the member route gives when open search
 *     is off — and the shared panel falls back to exact-email resolve, which is
 *     precisely what they have always had through `eligible-family`'s sibling
 *     surfaces. They lose a convenience, not a capability.
 *
 * (b) EVERY RESOLVE IS AUDITED, IDENTICALLY TO THE MEMBER PATH. "Admins can see
 *     everything" is not "admin lookups need no record". The same two audit
 *     writers the member routes use are called here with the same retention
 *     classes, so one query on `member_guest.search` returns members and
 *     officers together rather than officers being invisible in the trail that
 *     exists to make browsing detectable.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COPIED FROM THE MEMBER ROUTES
 *
 * No rate limit and no timing floor. Both exist to make a MEMBER's probing slow
 * and noisy against a surface that is otherwise a stranger-lookup oracle. An
 * officer with `membership:view` is not probing for something they are denied —
 * they hold the directory — so a limiter here would throttle legitimate work to
 * mitigate a risk that does not apply, and the audit trail is the control that
 * does. The email mode is available to any booking officer and is bounded by the
 * same thing that has always bounded it: you must already know the address.
 *
 * MODULE OFF ⇒ 404, never 403, for the same reason as the member routes: a 403
 * confirms the club has the feature and has switched it off, which is a fact
 * about the club an unauthorised caller has no business learning.
 */

 * must already know the address.
