/**
 * POST /api/admin/bookings/[id]/no-emails — turn the per-booking "No emails"
 * switch on or off (#2258, owner decision D10).
 *
 * While the switch is on, the mailer withholds EVERY member-facing message that
 * belongs to this booking — confirmation, modification, payment, reminders,
 * arrival information, cancellation, waitlist offers, chore rosters, and the
 * invoice email Xero would send on our behalf. Admin-audience alerts and all
 * account/security mail are unaffected: the switch is keyed on the booking, not
 * on the recipient's address.
 *
 * Authorisation mirrors the sibling exclusive-hold / capacity-hold routes and the
 * `notifyMember` contract (docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md): admin-only, and any
 * non-admin caller gets a 403 from `requireAdmin`. Enabling additionally
 * requires `acknowledged: true`; without it the request is refused with 400 and
 * nothing is written. Both set and clear are audited (who and when).
