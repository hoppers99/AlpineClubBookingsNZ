// Restore the built-in lobby-display boards (#2247).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `ensureBuiltInDisplays()` has exactly one other caller —
// `prisma/seed.ts` — and no deploy or upgrade path runs the seed
// (`DEPLOYMENT.md`; the migrate service runs `prisma migrate deploy` only). A
// database created before the lobby-display feature therefore has no
// `builtin-*` rows at all and the Templates gallery is simply empty, with
// nothing an operator can do about it.
//
// WHY IT IS AN EXPLICIT ADMIN ACTION AND NOT A DEPLOY STEP (owner decision,
// #2247). The ensure is a CONVERGENT upsert: its update blocks rewrite the full
// definition of every `builtin-*` row from code (owner decision A, #111). Wiring
// it into the deploy would silently revert an operator's local edits to a
// built-in on every release, and could overwrite customisations imported through
// config-transfer. Behind a button it is deliberate, auditable, and only ever a
// surprise the operator asked for — the UI states the overwrite before running
// it.
//
// Contract:
//  • WRITE — gated on `lodge:edit`, matching POST /api/admin/display/templates
//    (the sibling reads use `lodge:view`). The route resolves to the `lodge`
//    permission area via the `/api/admin/display` prefix.
//  • ATOMIC — the 14 upserts run inside one `$transaction`, so a database error
//    part-way through rolls the whole restore back rather than leaving a
//    half-restored library that nothing recorded. `ensureBuiltInDisplays` takes
//    a narrow client interface precisely so a transaction client can be passed,
//    and it makes no external provider calls, so nothing slow is held inside the
//    transaction.
//  • Idempotent — upsert by `key`, so a second run changes nothing and returns
//    the same counts. Safe to press twice.
//  • Convergent — an edited `builtin-*` row is rewritten back to its shipped
//    definition. That is the point of the action, and the reason it is audited.
//  • Touches ONLY the reserved `builtin-*` keys; custom templates and layouts,
//    and every device binding, are untouched (devices bind by `templateId`, and
//    an existing built-in keeps its row id through the upsert).
