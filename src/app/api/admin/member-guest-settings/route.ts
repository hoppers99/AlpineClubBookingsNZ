// route and the settings card it feeds in MG2, alongside the behaviour they
// control, so no admin can change a member-guest setting before the feature that
// reads it exists. MG1 (#2306) shipped the singleton, its defaults, and its
// config-transfer classification with deliberately no admin surface at all.
//
// Modelled on /api/admin/ai-assistant/settings (#2211, C3), which is the closest
// existing precedent: one LAZILY-created id="default" singleton, a `.strict()`
// zod body, a read-previous/upsert/audit interactive transaction, and a response
// carrying the values plus `updatedAt` / `updatedByMemberId`. The additions here
// are the view/manage capability signal and the bounds echo, both explained below.
//
// PERMISSION AREA: `bookings`, the same area as every other booking-policy
// settings route (booking-requests/settings, booking-policies/*, bed-allocation/
// settings). The path is registered on the `bookings` permissions prefix list in
// src/lib/admin-permissions.ts and pinned in the admin-route-area matrix, so it
// can never silently fall through to the `overview` catch-all.

 * never offered a control whose PUT is guaranteed to 403. `"none"` never appears
 * in a 200 body: the guard has already answered 401/403, and the card treats that
 * as the third state. It is named here so the card can type all three cases in
 * one discriminated union instead of inferring the third from a status code.
 *
 * A tri-state string rather than the `canEdit` boolean used by
 * /api/admin/fee-configuration, precisely because a boolean cannot distinguish
 * view-only from no-access and this card has to render both differently.
 *
 * Declared but NOT exported: no other route.ts in this app exports a type, and
 * the card that consumes this payload lands in a separate lane, so it declares
 * its own copy of the union rather than importing across the app/route boundary.
