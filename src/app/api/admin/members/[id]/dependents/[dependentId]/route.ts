      // PROVENANCE, not identity (#2255). This used to ask "does the stored
      // pointer name this parent, or this parent's own source?" — a ONE-HOP
      // test. Since the write side resolves transitively, a derived pointer now
      // routinely names an ancestor two or more hops up (link a child under a
      // grandparent whose address is a placeholder and the stored source is the
      // GREAT-grandparent). That pointer failed the one-hop test, so unlinking
      // left the member with no parent link at all and a permanent inheritance
      // from someone they are no longer connected to — while the response and
      // the audit entry both said `clearedEmailInheritance: false`, as if that
      // were the correct outcome.
      //
      // WHAT DECIDES THIS IS WHO THE DECISION NAMED, not the provenance flag.
      //
      // The rule used to gate on `inheritParentEmail`, on the stated grounds
      // that "a manually-chosen source sets it false". Review established that
      // it does not: the admin member-edit hand-pick writes the pointer and
      // choice WITHOUT touching the flag, which carries `@default(true)`, so a
      // hand-picked guardian is indistinguishable from a derived pointer by that
      // flag alone. This PR's own migration says so in as many words and uses an
      // ancestry test instead. Gating on the flag therefore silently replaced an
      // admin's hand-picked guardian with a parent on the next unlink — the
      // consent question this feature must not answer by itself.
      //
      // #2716: the CHOICE counts, not just the pointer. A dependant whose chosen
      // parent has temporarily lost their address holds a live choice beside a
      // NULL pointer, and unlinking that parent has to retire the decision —
      // testing the pointer alone would leave the choice naming a member who is
      // no longer a parent, resolving to nobody forever while the audit entry
      // reports nothing was cleared.
      //
      // So: retire the decision exactly when the decision named the parent being
      // unlinked. A hand-picked guardian is never that member, so it survives. A
      // pointer naming somebody who is neither parent is the retired transitive
      // shape, which the migration re-seated and the daily sweep converges; it
      // is deliberately not special-cased here.
