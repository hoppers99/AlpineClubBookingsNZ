/*
 * Member withdraws their own pending whole-lodge request (#2263, D3).
 *
 * BOUNDARY: member. Session-authenticated, deliberately token-free (unlike the
 * public quote-token cancel, whose caller has no account). Not registered in
 * `explicitPublicApiRoutes` — see the sibling submit route for why that would be
 * exactly the wrong mechanism; the per-method rationale is in
 * `mixedMethodApiRoutes`.
 *
 * Authorisation is not a read-then-write: the owner check is part of the
 * status-guarded claim inside `withdrawMemberWholeLodgeRequest`, so there is no
 * window between "is this mine?" and "cancel it", and someone else's request id
 * behaves exactly like an id that does not exist.
