/**
 * The pre-cutover warm-up gate (#2566, owner decision Option 4).
 *
 * `scripts/run-production-blue-green-deploy.sh` calls this ON the target release,
 * after the migrations have run and the target has passed its readiness and health
 * checks, and BEFORE it touches the Caddy upstream. The response's verdict decides
 * whether the cutover happens.
 *
 * ## Why the gate lives in the application rather than in the deploy script
 *
 * Three reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 *  1. **It is the strongest possible answer to "did we warm the right colour?"**
 *     The requests are made from inside the target container to its own loopback
 *     origin, so the process that stores each page is the process that answered.
 *     Nothing routes, so nothing can route to the live colour by mistake.
 *  2. **Untrusted CMS paths never touch a shell.** The owner's request-safety rules
 *     ("do not use `eval`", "do not concatenate unquoted CMS paths into shell
 *     commands", "pass each route safely as a separate HTTP-client argument") are
 *     satisfied structurally: the paths are read from the database into memory and
 *     handed to `fetch` as data.
 *  3. **The rules are testable.** Discovery, the tiered evaluation and the report
 *     are pure modules with unit coverage, which the same logic expressed in bash
 *     would not be.
 *
 * ## GET, deliberately
 *
 * Warming is idempotent — it populates a cache and reads pages — but a POST would
 * be the more honest verb. It is a GET because the runtime image's HTTP client is
 * busybox `wget` (`node:24-alpine`), which has no POST support, and the deploy
 * script reaches this endpoint exactly the way it reaches the readiness endpoint:
 * `docker compose exec -T <service> wget -qO- …`. Adding an HTTP client to the
 * production image to buy a verb would be the worse trade. The same reason is why
 * the cron secret arrives in a header the container reads from its OWN environment,
 * so it never appears in a host process list.
 *
 * ## Guarded, and one at a time
 *
 * `requireCronSecret()` — the same shared, constant-time guard
 * `/api/deploy/runtime-status` uses. A second concurrent run is refused rather than
 * queued: two warm-ups at once would double the CPU spike this design exists to
 * bound, moments before cutover.
