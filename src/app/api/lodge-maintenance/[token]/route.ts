/**
 * THE UNAUTHENTICATED DOOR (#2780, owner decision 5). Read this whole docblock
 * before changing anything in this file.
 *
 * WHAT A CALLER HOLDING A VALID TOKEN MAY DO. Exactly two things: read the active
 * question set plus the name of the lodge the token belongs to, and submit one
 * maintenance report for that lodge. Nothing else is readable or writable. There
 * is no account data on this surface at all — not a member name, not an email,
 * not a booking, not a count of anything — and the report it creates carries
 * `memberId: null` by construction rather than by a check (`AnonymousSubmission`
 * has no field for one).
 *
 * FOUR GATES, ALL ANSWERING THE SAME 404. The module must be on, the club-wide
 * `anonymousReportsEnabled` setting must be on, the token must resolve, and both
 * the token and its lodge must be active. Every failure returns the identical
 * generic 404 with no body detail, so the endpoint is not an oracle for "is this
 * a real token" or "does this club have the feature on". The module gate answers
 * upstream in `src/proxy.ts` from `FEATURE_ROUTE_RULES`; the other three answer
 * here, and `resolveLodgeForMaintenanceToken` collapses its own several failure
 * reasons to one `null` before this file ever sees them.
 *
 * THE TOKEN IS NEVER ECHOED. It is read from the path, hashed, and dropped. It is
 * not returned in any response body, not logged (the shared redaction layer
 * strips `/lodge-maintenance/<token>` from log lines and Sentry events), and not
 * put in an error message. The page that calls this route holds it in the URL the
 * browser already has and nowhere else.
 *
 * TWO SEPARATE BUDGETS, BOTH PER IP. Reads are throttled by
 * `maintenanceReportToken` (30 per 15 minutes) because the read is the only
 * endpoint that answers anything about a token at all, so it is what an
 * enumeration attempt would hammer; submits are throttled far harder by
 * `maintenanceReportAnonymous` (5 per hour) because each one costs the club a row
 * and an email. Sizing them together would either break an honest reload or hand
 * a script five hundred submissions.
 *
 * `no-store` ON EVERY RESPONSE. A tokenised page's JSON must never sit in a
 * shared cache, and a 404 must not be cached either — an admin who mints a token
 * a minute later would otherwise still be refused.
