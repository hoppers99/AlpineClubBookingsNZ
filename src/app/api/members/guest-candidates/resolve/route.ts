/**
 * `POST /api/members/guest-candidates/resolve` — MG3's exact-email member
 * finder (epic #2305, #2308). The mode every club gets on day one.
 *
 * **POST, not GET, and the method is load-bearing.** A GET would put another
 * member's email address into the URL, and from there into the access log, the
 * browser history, the `Referer` header of anything the page later loads, and
 * any proxy in between. A POST body goes to none of those.
 *
 * **Module OFF ⇒ 404**, never 403 — see `loadMemberGuestFindGate`.
 *
 * **ALWAYS 200 WITH THE SAME SHAPE** when the module is on. Not found,
 * all-inactive and no-such-member all return `{ candidates: [] }`; the server
 * never sends a reason, and the UI renders one fixed sentence. Nothing about
 * eligibility is evaluated here — see `member-guest-find-service.ts` for why
 * that is the single most important property of the design.
 *
 * **THE RESPONSE FLOOR.** Every answer, including the empty one, is held to the
 * same minimum duration as a collapsed cross-family refusal. Without it the
 * empty answer would be reliably the fast one — one indexed query against the
 * several a populated answer runs downstream — and the uniform envelope would be
 * defeated by a stopwatch. It narrows the channel rather than closing it, and
 * says so where it is defined.
