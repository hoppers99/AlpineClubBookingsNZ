/**
 * `GET /api/members/guest-candidates` — the one server-computed object the
 * booking wizard needs to draw the "+ Add Member Guest" surface (#2308 §5.1).
 *
 * WHY A ROUTE AND NOT A SERVER-RENDERED PROP. The plan asked for the flag to be
 * threaded from the `/book` page's server component; `/book` is a `"use client"`
 * page and has been since the wizard was extracted (#1209), so there is no
 * server component to thread from. This follows the shape the wizard already
 * uses for every other piece of server policy it draws — `/api/payments/options`
 * for group bookings and internet banking, `/api/bookings/rooms` for room
 * requests — rather than inventing a second mechanism for one flag.
 *
 * THE CLIENT VALUE IS NEVER THE GATE. Everything here is decoration: the two
 * find routes re-read the module flag and the settings singleton themselves, so
 * a client that flips `openSearchEnabled` in its own memory still gets a 404
 * from the route it then calls. This object decides what is DRAWN, never what is
 * ALLOWED.
 *
 * Module off answers `{ enabled: false }` rather than 404. Unlike the find
 * routes there is nothing to hide: the absence of the button already tells the
 * member the club does not use the feature, and a definite answer is what lets
 * the wizard avoid rendering a button it then has to take away.
