/**
 * `GET /api/members/guest-candidates/search?q=` — MG3's open name type-ahead
 * (epic #2305, #2308, owner decision MG3-D-b).
 *
 * **THIS ROUTE ONLY EXISTS WHEN A CLUB HAS DELIBERATELY TURNED IT ON.** Module
 * off, or `openMemberSearchEnabled` off, and it answers 404 exactly as any
 * unknown path would. Turning the setting off makes it disappear again
 * immediately — the gate is a settings read per request, not a build-time flag —
 * which is asserted by a test, because a privacy switch that needs a redeploy to
 * take effect is not a switch.
 *
 * **THE HONEST SECURITY MODEL, WHICH IS NOT SOFTENED ANYWHERE.** With open
 * member search ON, the club's member name list is **deliberately browsable** by
 * any member who can start a booking. A member can type "a", "b", "c" and page
 * through most of the roll. That is the owner's accepted trade (MG3-D-b), it is
 * a per-club choice, and it ships OFF. The remaining controls are:
 *
 *   1. the rate limit (a burst window and a real daily cap);
 *   2. the audit trail — every query is recorded against the member who typed
 *      it, so probing is detectable after the fact;
 *   3. the ten-row cap plus prefix-only matching, which makes bulk harvesting
 *      slow and noisy rather than one request;
 *   4. the minors exclusion, on by default.
 *
 * **No control makes the list unbrowsable; the setting's whole purpose is to
 * make it browsable.** The admin toggle says so in those words, and so does the
 * documentation.
 *
 * A GET is correct here where it was wrong for the email route: a name fragment
 * is not another member's contact detail, and the type-ahead needs the ordinary
 * request semantics.
