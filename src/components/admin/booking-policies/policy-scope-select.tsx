    #2701: this control had no error surface at all — a failed lodge list gave
    an empty `lodges`, which is the same shape as a single-lodge club, so it
    returned null and the section silently became "club-wide rules" with no way
    to reach a lodge's overrides. Club-wide rules are not a harmless default
    here: they apply to every lodge that has no override of its own, so an admin
    who meant to change one lodge changes all of them, and the control that
    would have said so is not on the page.

    Rendered INSTEAD of null, never alongside the select, so a section that has
    a scope control always has either the control or the reason it is missing.
