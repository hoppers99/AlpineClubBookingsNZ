/**
 * #2621 — the expected arrival time, staged and saved explicitly.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY IT MATTERED. The previous version saved on every
 * change of the dropdown and then rendered "Saved" **without ever looking at the
 * response**. `fetch` only rejects on a network failure, so a 400 (a time on a
 * booking whose check-in date has passed) and a 403 (a member editing a booking
 * that is not theirs) both resolved normally and both printed "Saved" in green
 * next to a value the server had refused. The member closed the page believing
 * the lodge knew when they were coming. On reload the old value came back, with
 * no explanation of which of the two was true.
 *
 * The fix is the shape `BookingNotesEditor` already uses on this same page:
 * stage the value locally, save on an explicit press, check `res.ok`, and put
 * the server's own message on screen when it says no. Auto-save is what made
 * dishonesty invisible here — a save the member did not ask for has no obvious
 * place to report that it failed.
 *
 * "Saved" is now only ever rendered after a response the server called
 * successful, and `savedTime` (not the staged value) is what the read-only
 * summary shows, so the screen never claims a time is recorded that is not.
