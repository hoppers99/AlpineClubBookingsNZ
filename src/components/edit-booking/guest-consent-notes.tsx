 * from a tense-corrected version of the same sentence.
 *
 * The columns handed to the badge function are a REAL sub-state of the eight-
 * shape table, not an approximation: `AWAITING_TARGET` without its expiry (the
 * wizard audience shows no date, and a null cannot leak into a rendered
 * deadline the way an invented one could), or `NOTIFY_ONLY_AUTO_CONFIRMED`
 * exactly. Returns null for every other added guest.
