/**
 * The consent card — the member's own answer to "can I be added to this
 * booking?" ("+ Add Member Guest", epic #2305, MG2 #2307).
 *
 * Renders on `/bookings/[id]` immediately above the #2250 self-removal card,
 * under the `#consent` anchor the request email deep-links to. Owner decision
 * D-11 gives the pending member the whole booking page, so this card sits
 * inside the real page rather than replacing it.
 *
 * REFUSALS FOLLOW #2250 EXACTLY (owner decision D-14, mockup section 4).
 * `refusalWarning` is the server-composed warning for a refusal that is
 * PREDICTABLE before the click — when set, the "No thanks" button is not
 * rendered at all and the warning explains who can act instead. The
 * settled-payment refusal is NOT predictable, so both buttons stay on the page
 * and the server's 400 message is repeated word for word if it is refused.
 *
 * NO `router.refresh()` ON EITHER SUCCESS, deliberately, on the #2250 card's
 * reasoning. A successful DECLINE deletes the viewer's guest row, so
 * re-rendering the server component would redirect them to /bookings and
 * replace the confirmation they just earned with a list. A successful APPROVE
 * keeps their access, but a refresh would unmount this card mid-confirmation —
 * so both outcomes keep the confirmation on screen and say plainly that the
 * details above show the booking as it was.
