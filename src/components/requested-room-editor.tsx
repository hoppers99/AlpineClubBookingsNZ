 * response**. `fetch` only rejects on a network failure, so the 400 from the
 * room validator, the 403 from the ownership check, and the 409 the writer
 * raises once the lodge has allocated the beds all resolved normally and all
 * printed "Saved" in green beside a room the server had refused. The member
 * closed the page believing the lodge knew which room they wanted. On reload
 * the old value came back, with no explanation of which of the two was true.
 *
 * The fix is the shape its sibling on this same page already uses
 * (`arrival-time-editor.tsx`, #2621/#2657): stage the choice locally, save on
 * an explicit press, check `response.ok`, and put the server's own message on
 * screen when it says no. Auto-save is what made the dishonesty invisible here
 * — a save the member did not ask for has no obvious place to report that it
 * failed. Two editors sit on this one booking page, and a member now meets the
 * same interaction model in both.
 *
 * "Saved" is now only ever rendered after a response the server called
 * successful, and `savedRoom` (not the staged pick) is what the read-only
 * summary and the inactive-room chip show, so the screen never claims a room
 * is recorded that is not.
