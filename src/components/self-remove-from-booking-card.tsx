/**
 * Lets a member who was put on somebody ELSE's booking take themselves off it
 * from the booking they are looking at (#2250).
 *
 * Before this the only entry point in the whole app was the booking wizard's
 * night-conflict card, so a member could only discover the action while trying
 * to make a clashing booking of their own.
 *
 * Eligibility is NOT re-derived here. `canSelfRemove` and `blockedReason` are
 * computed on the server by `evaluateGuestSelfRemoval`, the same rule the
 * removal service enforces. When the member is not eligible the action is
 * HIDDEN rather than disabled (a disabled button's `title` never fires — the
 * shared button variants set `disabled:pointer-events-none`) and the reason is
 * stated in the reading order instead.
 *
 * NO `router.refresh()` ON SUCCESS, deliberately — the one place in this repo
 * where the house pattern (`cancel-booking-button.tsx`,
 * `delete-booking-button.tsx`) does not apply. Once the guest row is gone the
 * member no longer satisfies the detail route's own guard
 * (`isLinkedGuestViewer`), so re-rendering the server component would redirect
 * them to /bookings and replace the confirmation they just earned with a list.
 * The booking summary above therefore still shows the party and total as they
 * were; the success card says so and offers the way out, rather than silently
 * leaving stale figures on screen.
