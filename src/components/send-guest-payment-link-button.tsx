/**
 * Split-booking guest-portion affordance (#1967). Shown with the
 * switch-to-Internet-Banking control (pre-switch) and on the booking page
 * after the member's own place is settled by internet banking: because paying
 * the member's own place by internet banking leaves no card on file for the
 * later guest charge, this lets the booker email themselves a secure payment
 * link for the guest portion. It posts to
 * /api/bookings/[id]/send-guest-payment-link, a true send/RE-SEND: an existing
 * link is revoked and a fresh one sent (raw tokens are never stored, so a new
 * mint is the only way to re-send), while a link minted within the last minute
 * short-circuits server-side — pressing the button twice never fans out
 * duplicate emails or leaves two live links.
