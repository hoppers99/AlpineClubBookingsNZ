/**
 * #2685 review — the payments screen swallowed its own 400.
 *
 * `fetchData` was `if (res.ok) { … }` with no `else`, so a refused filter left
 * the PREVIOUS query's rows on screen underneath the new filter chip, and the
 * reason existed only in a network panel. This is the half of the fix that can
 * be tested away from the page: given the body the route actually sends, the
 * screen gets a sentence worth rendering.
 *
 * The corpus below is built from the real schema rather than from a hand-written
 * imitation of it, so a message that changes shape fails here.
