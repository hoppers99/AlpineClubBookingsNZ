/**
 * The MANDATORY-CATEGORY contract (#2581, child 2's third part).
 *
 * The type is the first line of defence and the census contract test is the
 * third. This describes the second: the runtime assertion at the write
 * boundary, which is the one that still holds when a caller reaches the helper
 * through a cast, from untyped JavaScript, or by forwarding a category read out
 * of a stored row.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST WOULD CATCH, since "it throws on a bad value" is not by itself
 * worth a test file:
 *
 *  - deleting `assertCanonicalAuditCategory` from ONE of the two builders — the
 *    four-boundary test fails, naming the boundary, because a writer that
 *    reaches the structured builder is covered by a different call than one that
 *    reaches the params builder;
 *  - narrowing the check to `typeof category === "string"` — the "invented
 *    value" cases fail, which are the exact two values (`membership`, `auth`)
 *    that reached production through the old `(string & {})` escape;
 *  - making `logAudit` await or rethrow — the fire-and-forget test fails;
 *  - swallowing the throw inside `createAuditLog` so the audit failure stops
 *    aborting its transaction — the rollback test fails;
 *  - restoring the `params.retentionClass || params.category || params.severity`
 *    gate — the "no boundary can emit the kept-forever shape" test fails.
