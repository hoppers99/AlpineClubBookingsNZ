  #2263 / ADR-001 (dated entry, 2026-07-30) — the sanctioned front-doors that may
  ASK for a whole-lodge exclusive hold.

  The behavioural pin in booking-request.test.ts proves the PUBLIC create path
  writes no `exclusivityRequested`. It cannot prove anything about a door that
  does not exist yet: a fourth front-door added next year would simply not be
  covered by a test nobody thought to write. This scan closes that. It finds
  every WRITE of `exclusivityRequested` in the source tree and asserts the set of
  files containing one is exactly the sanctioned set.

  Why this flag is worth a scan of its own. It is the request-side half of the
  one capacity action that sterilises every bed in the lodge (ADR-001). A path
  that could set it without an authenticated, capped, audited requester behind it
  would let somebody ask the club to empty the building on a date of their
  choosing. The ADMIN action that GRANTS the hold (`Booking.wholeLodgeHold`) is a
  separate flag and deliberately out of scope: an admin may set that on any
  booking, and only the REQUEST front-doors are enumerated here.

  It runs over the TypeScript AST rather than over file text, for the reason
  `view-only-banner-contract.test.ts` had to learn twice: raw text cannot tell a
  write from a Prisma `select`, from a type declaration, or from prose about any
  of them — and the files in this area are heavily commented with the very
  expressions being matched.

  Adding a legitimate new door means adding it to SANCTIONED_WRITE_SITES with a
  reason, which is exactly the reviewable diff this test exists to force.

/*
  The scan roots. `src/` is the obvious one; `prisma/` and `scripts/` are here

  could stamp `exclusivityRequested` on rows with no requester, no cap, no audit
  and no attribution, and a src-only scan would never see it. Neither directory
  is allowed a write site at all, so both simply must contribute nothing to the
