/**
 * Handing a fixture to one of this repository's real `bash` gate scripts
 * (#2886).
 *
 * Several suites prove a shell gate by running it for real against a throwaway
 * fixture built under `os.tmpdir()`, with the fixture's location and the gate's
 * knobs supplied as environment variables:
 *
 * - `review-findings-contracts.test.ts` → `validate-blue-green-migrations.sh`,
 *   `check-migration-safety-coverage.sh`
 * - `blue-green-ledger-lint.test.ts` → `validate-blue-green-migrations.sh`
 * - `data-migration-verification-gate.test.ts` →
 *   `check-data-migration-verification.sh`
 *
 * On Windows `bash` is whatever PATH resolves, and on a stock Windows 11
 * developer machine that is `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe` — the **WSL**
 * launcher, not Git Bash. Two independent things then go wrong, and both were
 * measured on the Windows host in #2886.
 *
 * ## Mechanism 1 — a drive-letter path does not exist inside WSL
 *
 * WSL runs the script in a Linux filesystem namespace:
 *
 * ```
 * $ bash -c 'ls -d C:/Users'
 * ls: cannot access 'C:/Users': No such file or directory
 * ```
 *
 * so the gate reported `Migration SQL file not found: C:/Users/…/migration.sql`
 * and every assertion built on that run failed — 48 of them in
 * `review-findings-contracts.test.ts` alone, on a clean tree, identically when
 * the suite ran alone.
 *
 * Flipping the separators (`C:\Users\…` → `C:/Users/…`), which is what these
 * suites used to do, does not help. It fixes a *different*, real problem (Git
 * Bash drops the backslashes out of an argv element, so `C:\Users\x` arrives as
 * `C:Usersx`), but the result is still a drive-letter path and WSL cannot open
 * one whatever the slashes look like.
 *
 * What works is a path expressed **relative to the working directory the script
 * is spawned with**. Node spawns these with `cwd` at the repository root, and
 * every bash translates its own working directory — WSL reports
 * `/mnt/c/Users/…/repo`, Git Bash reports `/c/Users/…/repo` — so a relative
 * path resolves correctly under either, with no need to know which is
 * installed. When the repository and fixture are on different volumes, no
 * relative path exists; the selected shell translates the absolute path with
 * `wslpath` or `cygpath` instead. Measured, passing the same fixture to a real
 * script:
 *
 * | Form handed to bash                                   | Result  |
 * | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
 * | `C:/Users/…/Temp/x/migration.sql` (what shipped)       | MISSING |
 * | `../../AppData/Local/Temp/x/migration.sql` (relative)  | FOUND   |
 *
 * ## Mechanism 2 — environment variables do not cross into WSL
 *
 * This one is worse, because it fails silently rather than loudly. Variables
 * put on `spawnSync`'s `env` option are Win32 environment variables, and the
 * WSL launcher does not forward them; the script sees them **unset** and falls
 * back to its production defaults. So a test that pointed the validator at a
 * throwaway ledger was in fact running it against the repository's real
 * `docs/BLUE_GREEN_MIGRATION_SAFETY.tsv` — a fixture substitution with no error
 * message at all. Measured, with the same script printing what it received:
 *
 * | How the variable was supplied                | Script saw            |
 * | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
 * | `spawnSync({ env: { …, LEDGER: "x" } })`      | `UNSET`               |
 * | `bash -c "LEDGER='x' exec bash script args"`  | `x`                   |
 *
 * Inlining the assignments into the command string is portable rather than
 * WSL-specific, and it is already this repository's working idiom:
 * `adult-member-hosting-coverage-migration.test.ts` has always built its
 * validator invocation that way, and it is the one suite in this family that
 * never showed either failure.
 *
 * ## Why this was recorded as something else
 *
 * Both mechanisms are platform-deterministic: they reproduce on a clean tree,
 * with the suite run alone, every time. They had been written down as
 * "load-sensitive timeouts — re-run it alone", which is why the cost kept
 * repeating: re-running cannot help, because load was never involved.
 *
 * ## Linux and CI
 *
 * {@link bashFixturePath} returns its input unchanged wherever `path.sep` is
 * already `/`, so CI hands the scripts byte-for-byte the strings it did before.
 * {@link bashGateArgs} does change the invocation shape everywhere — the same
 * script, the same argv, the same variables, reached through one `-c` string
 * instead of the `env` option — and that equivalence was checked on Linux by
 * running both shapes over the same fixtures inside `node:24-bookworm` and
 * comparing exit status, stdout and stderr.
