/**
 * The one hut-leader overlap predicate, and the SCHOOL carve-out (#2887, #2926).
 *
 * Consolidating four hand-copied versions of this rule into one predicate is
 * what this file guards: the >1-day comparison, the lodge scope and the
 * exclude-self behaviour now have a single home, so they cannot drift between
 * the POST, the PUT and the cron.
 *
 * School-teacher rows ARE excluded now (#2926), on the row's own
 * `source` provenance. Behaviour on real rows — including the reclassification
 * case, which is the whole reason the first attempt was reverted — is proved
 * against a real PostgreSQL in `hut-leader-teacher-exclusion.realdb.test.ts`.
 * What THIS file can prove is the shape of the query, and that is worth pinning
 * separately: the failure mode being guarded against is a filter that reads
 * correctly and whose meaning an admin can move.

      the ones the school-approval path CREATED — and did not change what the
      predicate is allowed to ask about. The half that matters is unchanged and
      is still asserted below: the query names no member, no role and no access
      role. A filter derived from the member is exactly what was shipped and
      reverted once, and nothing else in this file would notice it coming back.

      WHICH ROWS THIS COVERS, stated because the previous version of this test
      demanded it be stated: rows whose `source` is `SCHOOL_BOOKING`, i.e. the
      one-per-teacher assignments `school-booking-request.ts` creates when a
      school request is approved. NOT "rows belonging to a member whose role is

      The mirror of the test above, and the reason the flag is opt-in.

      The carve-out answers "may a DELIBERATE assignment stand here?" — an
      officer putting a leader beside a school group is not to be refused. It
      does not answer "should an automatic job plant one?", and applying it to
      the nightly job was a reachable defect:

        teachers 10-14 Aug at a lodge; a sole adult member's stay 12-20 Aug; the
        job reaches 15 Aug, whose coverage probe finds nothing; with the carve-out
        applied the span read over 12-20 Aug skipped the teacher rows and the job
        planted a CRON row across 12-20 — including the school nights it is
        documented never to reach. Being MANUAL-equivalent, that row then blocked
        officers across the whole span.

      So omitting the flag must leave NO source filter, which restores exactly
      the pre-carve-out refusal for the job. Asserted on the query rather than on
      an outcome, because the whole point is that the automatic caller asks a
      different question from the deliberate one.
