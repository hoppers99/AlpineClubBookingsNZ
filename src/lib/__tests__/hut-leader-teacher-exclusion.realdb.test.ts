/**
 * Real-PostgreSQL proof that the hut-leader overlap predicate's school-teacher
 * carve-out is keyed on the ROW and not on the member (#2926).
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS AT ALL, when a mocked `findMany` can already assert the
 * shape of the `where`. The defect this issue was split out for was not a wrong
 * `where` — it was a `where` that read correctly and whose meaning MOVED when
 * somebody edited a member. A shape assertion cannot see that: it pins the
 * query, and the query was never the thing that changed. Only executing the
 * predicate against real rows, on either side of the real membership edit, shows
 * that the same live assignment is still found afterwards.
 *
 * The first attempt filtered on `member.role != "SCHOOL"`. `Member.role` is
 * derived from the access roles (`legacyRoleFromAccessRoles` maps `ORG` ->
 * `SCHOOL`) and the member editor's User Type control writes them, so
 * reclassifying an ordinary member as an organisation removed their LIVE
 * assignment from the predicate for every writer. `THE RECLASSIFICATION CASE`
 * below is that exact sequence, and it fails against that filter.
 *
 * Ordinary Vitest runs skip this. The explicit concurrency job imports the file
 * from `concurrency-lock-races.realdb.test.ts` after migrating a disposable,
 * loopback-only database, which is the same guarded harness (#1881) every other
 * `*.realdb.test.ts` uses — so no workflow change is needed to run it, and it
 * can never touch a database that is not the throwaway one.
