/**
 * #2623 T7. A member who WAS successfully linked after a provider-created /
 * link-failed Xero contact create kept blocking member merge and account
 * deletion indefinitely, because neither blocker predicate consults
 * `Member.xeroContactId` and no link path closed the operation. The half that
 * made it a dead end rather than an inconvenience was discoverability: this page
 * reported a completely clean Xero state, so an operator hit an unexplained
 * refusal with nothing to search for and no hint that the remedy lives on the
 * Xero Operations screen.
 *
 * These assertions pin the disclosure, and that it is keyed on the blocker
 * itself rather than on whether the member happens to be linked.
