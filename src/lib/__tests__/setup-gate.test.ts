/**
 * "Not ready yet" until site setup is complete (#2420).
 *
 * The defect: while `ClubTheme.completedAt IS NULL`, `(website)/layout.tsx`
 * returns its holding screen instead of `{children}`, the page component never
 * runs, and EVERY public address — real page, typo, and bot probe alike —
 * answers `200 OK`. Search engines are told a dead address is fine and
 * monitoring cannot tell an unconfigured site from a working one.
 *
 * Both halves of the contract are pinned here, and the second is as load-bearing
 * as the first:
 *  - with setup incomplete, every public-website address is 503 with the holding
 *    screen, and the admin area / API / setup wizard / login are untouched, so
 *    an operator part-way through setup can still finish it;
 *  - with setup complete, the gate is inert and behaviour is exactly as before —
 *    a change that 503s a live club's website would be far worse than the bug.
