/**
 * Test doubles for the hosting participant fence (#2597, hardened in #2619).
 *
 * `acquireHostingCoverageQueueParticipantProof` locks the exact sorted Member
 * rows `FOR KEY SHARE NOWAIT`, then does two reads UNDER that lock:
 *
 *   1. a typed `member.findMany` re-read, requiring every locked id to still
 *      exist, in sorted order;
 *   2. a `booking.findMany` re-read of each source booking's owner and lodge,
 *      requiring the `sourceFingerprint` to match what the caller planned.
 *
 * A double that models neither read makes the fence report contention — or
 * crash outright when the delegate is missing — so before #2619 these suites
 * exercised their seams with the fence effectively switched off. Modelling both
 * reads is what makes the drift check mean anything: it must PASS for unchanged
 * data and FAIL for drifted data, and a double that always returns nothing can
 * do neither.
 *
 * These helpers deliberately answer only the fence's own query shapes and
 * delegate everything else, so adding them to an existing double cannot change
 * what the rest of a suite already asserts.

/**
 * `adultMemberHostingPolicy.findMany` for the mode gate that now stands IN FRONT
 * of the fence (#2623 T5).
 *
 * `reconcileAdultMemberHostingReviewWithSiblings` reads the lodge's resolved
 * hosting mode before acquiring a participant proof, so a club with the rule off
 * pays no row lock on an ordinary booking write. That read is not new to those
 * paths: `evaluateBookingAdultMemberHosting` has always loaded the same policy
 * for the same lodge through the same client, one call deeper. A double reaches
 * it now only because the seams above bail out at
 * `if (!Array.isArray(booking.guests))` before the evaluation ever runs — an
 * artifact of narrow booking fixtures, not of production, where the reconciler's
 * select always hydrates the relation.
 *
 * THE ROW IS DELIBERATELY AN *ACTIVE* MODE. A double that answered `DISABLED`
 * (or `[]`, which resolves to `DISABLED`) would take the new gate's early return
 * and switch the participant fence off in exactly the suites #2619 added it to,
 * re-creating the "exercised their seams with the fence effectively switched
 * off" state described above — silently, and with the fence doubles beside it
 * still looking like coverage. `ENFORCED` keeps the fence on the path, so these
 * suites behave exactly as they did before the gate existed.
 *
 * The scope set is the narrowest one that is still a decided set: `sameBooking`
 * only. `sameBookingOwner` would pull the coverage-owner advisory key and the
 * same-owner settle step into suites that never modelled either.
 *
 * `mode` IS THEREFORE NOT A FREE KNOB (#2675 review). Callers may pick between
 * the two ACTIVE modes — `ENFORCED` (a hosting hazard refuses the write) and
 * `ADMIN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` (it is recorded and the write proceeds) — because that
 * choice changes what a suite's own assertions see. They may not select an
 * inactive one: `hostingModeIsActive` admits only those two, so anything else
 * re-opens the #2623 T5 bypass in the very suites this helper exists to close it
 * in. The census in `adult-member-hosting-call-sites.test.ts` cannot catch that
 * on its own — it can only see that the helper is CALLED — so the refusal is
 * here, at the one place the value is written.

 * that carries `isMember: true` with no `member` relation is therefore a shape
 * production cannot emit, and it does not fail honestly: `member !== null` is
 * TRUE for `undefined`, so the predicate goes on to read `undefined.active` and
 * the seam throws a `TypeError` instead of treating the guest as a non-member.
 *
 * That never showed while the fence doubles left the lodge's hosting mode at the
 * resolver's `DISABLED` default, because `evaluateBookingAdultMemberHosting`
 * builds no participants at all unless the mode is active. Pairing

 * what makes a suite genuinely hosting-evaluable.
 *
 * ADULT AND IN GOOD STANDING by default, because that is the shape that keeps an
 * existing suite's assertions intact: an adult member participant qualifies as a
 * host, so a fixture whose guests are all members raises no hosting violation
 * and the seam behaves exactly as it did with the rule off — while the fence in
 * front of it is now genuinely exercised. Pass `overrides` to model a lapsed,
 * archived or non-adult member deliberately, and `null` (not a partial row) to
 * model a true non-member guest.
 *
 * THE CALLER MUST PASS THE GUEST ROW'S OWN `ageTier` rather than relying on the
 * ADULT default (#2675 review). `BookingGuest.ageTier` and `Member.ageTier` are
 * separate columns that a real row always agrees on, and
 * `participantQualifiesAsHost` reads the MEMBER's. Deriving this row from
 * `memberId` alone therefore turns any member-linked CHILD or YOUTH guest into
 * an adult host and suppresses a hosting violation production would raise —
 * silently, because nothing in the suite asserts the tier.
