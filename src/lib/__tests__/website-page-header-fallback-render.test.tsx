/**
 * The hero header of the three established website pages: `/join`, `/join/apply`
 * and `/contact` (#2819).
 *
 * Each page has two header branches, and only ONE of them may be an HTML sink:
 *  - a genuine stored `PageContent.headerText` is admin-authored HTML, sanitised
 *    on write and again on read, and clubs format it — it keeps rendering through
 *    `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`;
 *  - the fallback is a sentence this application COMPOSES, on two of the three
 *    pages by interpolating the club identity, which no sanitiser has ever seen.
 *    It must render as an escaped React text child.
 *
 * The fallback branch was previously unreachable in a seeded deployment, which is
 * exactly why it needs pinning here rather than left to starter data: these tests
 * deliberately remove or blank the row, which is the state a deployment is in
 * before its content is seeded, and the state a club reaches by clearing the
 * field. The same fix landed on the two newer form pages in #2818; that suite is
 * `booking-request-pages-fallback-render.test.tsx`.
 *
 * This file pins rendered BEHAVIOUR, which is the right level for the escaping
 * and for the branch each input takes. It cannot state the underlying rule
 * exactly — a sink handed a sentence that interpolates nothing renders the same
 * DOM as a text child — so the rule itself is pinned over the page SOURCE, for all
 * five heroes at once, in `src/app/__tests__/website-hero-header-sink-contract.test.ts`.
