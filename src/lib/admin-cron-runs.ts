/**
 * Which `CronJobRun` rows a cron-health view has to read.
 *
 * Extracted from `src/app/api/admin/health/route.ts` (AID-6A, #2375) so the AI
 * Diagnostics background-job evidence tool and the Admin > Health screen classify
 * job health from the SAME rows. `admin-cron-health.ts` already owns the
 * authoritative CLASSIFICATION (current / stale / failed / skipped / missing /
 * disabled); what lived only in the route was the equally load-bearing question of
 * WHICH runs to hand it, and a second copy of that would let the two surfaces
 * disagree about whether a nightly job is overdue.
 *
 * The selection is deliberately not "the most recent N runs" alone: a
 * 15-minute job produces enough rows to push a daily job's last run out of any
 * global window, so the daily job would read as `missing` on a busy deployment.
 * Each expected job therefore also contributes its own recent history plus its
 * latest success and latest failure.
 *
 * READ-ONLY, and metadata only at the point of use: this returns the whole
 * `CronJobRun` row (the classifier needs `status` and the timestamps), and every
 * consumer projects it. The Diagnostics tool's projection drops `error` and
 * `resultSummary` — raw error text and arbitrary JSON, which ADR-003/ADR-004
 * keep out of the evidence channel entirely.
 *
 * THE FAN-OUT IS BOUNDED, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. Three queries
 * per expected job plus one global read is 103 statements at 34 tracked jobs, and
 * issuing them all through a single `Promise.all` put 103 concurrent queries on the
 * APPLICATION connection pool per call. That was survivable as an admin page load and
 * is not survivable as a diagnostics tool: a model may spend up to
 * `maxToolCallsPerSession` calls on job health in one operator question, and each call
 * whose 15-second deadline expires abandons its queries WITHOUT cancelling them
 * (`Promise.race` does not cancel the loser, and nothing propagates a cancellation
 * into Prisma). So the per-job reads now run in bounded batches, and a caller may
 * supply a deadline after which no further batch is ISSUED — which is what actually
 * stops a slow database turning one diagnostics question into a pile of queued work.
 *
 * A DEADLINE REFUSES; IT DOES NOT RETURN LESS. Handing the classifier a partial run
 * set would silently reclassify live jobs as `missing` — a fabricated verdict, and a
 * worse outcome than no answer. So the deadline throws, and the Diagnostics executor
 * turns that into `evidence_unavailable` with no rows.
