/**
 * Shared admin-member display helpers.
 *
 * The admin members list (`/admin/members`) and member detail
 * (`/admin/members/[id]`) pages both render finance access, lifecycle,
 * and login badges. Keeping the badge class maps and lifecycle helper
 * in one place stops the two pages drifting on colour/label decisions.
 *
 * The two pages disagree on finance access label phrasing (the list
 * prefers short labels like "Viewer", detail prefers long labels like
 * "Finance Viewer"). Both phrasings are exported here so each page
 * keeps the copy it already ships with.
