 * Booking-side integration for the adult-member hosting policy (#2364).
 *
 * The evaluator in `policies/adult-member-hosting.ts` is pure; this module is
 * the only place that turns a persisted booking into evaluator input and turns
 * the answer back into review state. Keeping it in one place is what makes the
 * "any change re-evaluates" requirement tractable: every booking mutation calls
 * `reconcileAdultMemberHostingReview`, and none of them has to understand the
 * rule.
 *
 * The reconciler is IDEMPOTENT and derives everything from live rows, so calling
 * it twice, or from a path that changed nothing, is a no-op that writes nothing.
 * That is deliberate — it means a new call site can be added anywhere without
 * having to reason about what the previous one did.

 *    night becomes hosted, clear the pending review automatically" requirement,
 *    and it fires for every reason a hazard can end: an adult member was added,
 *    a non-member guest left, the nights moved, the member was reinstated, the

 *    had the rule. A DECIDED review is cleared too — the thing that was decided
 *    no longer exists, so leaving it would leave the booking permanently
 *    labelled with a hazard nobody can see in its guest list.
 *  - **Hazard, none recorded before.** Open it as PENDING. `openedStatus` lets a
 *    caller that has ALREADY captured an explicit decision (an admin on-behalf
 *    reason, per D-R4) open it as APPROVED instead — but only by supplying that
 *    reason, which is what stops a silent auto-approval.
 *  - **Hazard, and the recorded one is materially different.** Reopen as PENDING
 *    and drop the previous decision: a different set of uncovered guest-nights,
 *    or a different policy revision, is a different question.
 *  - **Hazard, materially identical.** Write nothing. An admin's decision stands
 *    while the hazard it was made about stands, and the guest list shuffling
 *    underneath it does not re-prompt them.
