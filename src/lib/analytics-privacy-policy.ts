/**
 * The club's canonical privacy policy, as the Google Analytics setup panel needs to
 * describe it (#2573, owner clarification 5).
 *
 * There is deliberately NO Google-Analytics-specific privacy-policy URL setting. The
 * application already has one canonical privacy policy — the built-in `/privacy`
 * page in the admin-authored content tree (`isBuiltinPageSlug("privacy")`, linked
 * from every public footer) — and adding a second field would let a club end up with
 * two answers to one question, with the analytics panel pointing at the one nobody
 * maintains.
 *
 * So this reads the existing page and reports three things the panel needs: does the
 * page exist, is it published, and where does the admin go to edit it. A club with no
 * published privacy policy gets a prominent warning and a link to the website content
 * settings — but setup is NOT blocked on it, which is the clarification's other half.
 *
 * The same state answers a second question, for the VISITOR rather than the admin:
 * `resolveAnalyticsRuntimeConfig` uses it to decide whether the consent banner may
 * link the policy at the point of the decision. `PRIVACY_POLICY_ADMIN_HREF` and
 * {@link PrivacyPolicyPageState} therefore live in `analytics-settings-shared.ts`,
 * which the `"use client"` admin card can import; this module keeps the read.
