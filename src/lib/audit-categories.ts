/**
 * The canonical audit-category taxonomy (#2581).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `AuditLog.category` is not a display label. It is the
 * only thing a category-filtered reader can filter on, so it decides which
 * permission an operator needs before the platform will show them an event:
 * the AI Diagnostics correlation tools (#2375) select on
 * `category = ANY (…)` and nothing else, and a row whose category is wrong is a
 * row read by the wrong people, while a row whose category is missing is a row
 * read by nobody. Before this module the taxonomy was written out by hand in six
 * places — the writer union in `audit.ts`, the Admin filter options, the legacy
 * action filters, the member-visible subset, the badge map and the Diagnostics
 * category sets — and they had already drifted: `family` was written by 27
 * production sites while being absent from the writer union and from every
 * Diagnostics set, so family evidence was unreadable by any correlation tool.
 *
 * So this is one closed list, and everything else derives from it.
 *
 * THE LIST IS CLOSED, and that is the point. The old writer union ended in
 * `| (string & {})`, which accepts any string — and two invented values got in
 * through it (`membership` on three nomination writers, `auth` on the
 * auth-bounce writer), each producing rows no reader anywhere could filter for.
 * A misspelling would have done the same silently. With the escape gone,
 * `category: "membershp"` is a type error.
 *
 * CATEGORY FOLLOWS THE AFFECTED BUSINESS DOMAIN — never who acted, never which
 * folder the file is in, never whether a cron job or a person did it. That is
 * the owner's binding rule on #2581, and it is why the member-photo writers no
 * longer choose between `admin` and `account` based on whether an administrator
 * acted on the member's behalf: the affected domain is the member's own profile
 * either way.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DECIDE. Member-facing exposure. The
 * member timeline's visible subset stays a separately reviewed list in
 * `audit-query.ts`; adding a category here must never publish it to members as
 * a side effect.
 *
 * That promise covers ADDING a category. It does not cover RE-CLASSIFYING a
 * writer, which moves its rows across the member boundary whenever the old and
 * new categories sit on different sides of it — the member timeline filters on
 * category too. #2581 crossed it four times, all in the same direction and all
 * disclosed at the writer: the three membership-application writers
 * (`membership` → `account`), the auth-bounce writer (`auth` → `security`), and
 * the on-behalf branch of the two member-photo writers (`admin` → `account`).
 * Every one of those rows is about the member who can now see it, and the member
 * projection returns no metadata, no request id, no IP and no drill-downs.
 * `audit-writer-census.test.ts` pins the member-visible set so the next crossing
 * is a named test failure rather than a discovery.

 * running the entry the caller does hold.
 *
 * TWO ASSIGNMENTS HERE CHANGE WHO CAN READ AN EVENT, and both are deliberate.
 *
 *  - `communication` moves OUT of the support-only system entry (#2581
 *    decision 7). Bulk-communication and notice-delivery events carry recipient
 *    addresses in their payloads and are membership work, so the reader now
 *    needs `membership:view` as well. This REMOVES evidence a support-only
 *    operator can correlate today; it is a deliberate narrowing under least
 *    privilege, not a refactor.
 *  - `family` joins the membership entry. It was in no set at all, so 27
 *    production write sites were readable by no correlation tool; they are now
 *    readable with `support:view` plus `membership:view`. That is a widening of
 *    a real population to its least-privilege destination.
 *
 * `admin`, `security` and `system` remain readable with `support:view` alone.
 * That is why classifying anything INTO them is the assignment that needs a
 * written justification: `support` already governs Admin > Audit Log, where the
 * same operator reads the same rows in full, but the correlation channel is
 * reached by a model rather than by a person navigating to a screen.
