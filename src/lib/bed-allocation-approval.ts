/**
 * Whether an admin has confirmed (locked) the bed allocation for a booking.
 *
 * Issue #776: members may set/clear their requested room until the lodge
 * confirms beds. The lock signal is the presence of at least one approved
 * BedAllocation row for the booking — `approveBedAllocations` stamps
 * `approvedAt`/`approvedByMemberId` when an admin explicitly confirms beds.
 * Unapproved (auto-suggested or pending manual) allocations do not lock it.
 *
 * The lock is NOT one-way (#2252). Two existing paths can take the booking's
 * last approved row away again and re-open the member's editor:
 *   - a board move re-drafts the row it updates (the upsert update branch
 *     clears `approvedAt`/`approvedByMemberId`);
 *   - `deleteBedAllocation` removes it outright.
 * Neither is a dedicated "un-approve" action — they are documented side
 * effects — but the in-booking panel warns before removing the last approved
 * row, because the member silently regaining the editor is a real consequence.
