// Runtime import guard: a small, single-source-of-truth registry of the exact
// byte-strings that "cleanup" migrations removed from the starter/seed data,
// paired with the migration that removed each.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (#2511, found by the #2431 review)
//
// A config-transfer bundle exported BEFORE a cleanup migration still carries the
// old value: the exporter selects the DB column verbatim (see
// `categories/site-content.ts` — `pageContent.findMany`/`siteContent.findMany`
// select `headerText`/`contentHtml` as-is), and the applier writes it straight
// back with `pageContent.update` / `siteContent.update`, in BOTH import modes
// (merge only skips fields that are blank in the bundle, and these are full
// values). The boot auto-import (ADR-003) runs AFTER migrations —
// `bootstrap-import.ts` states the order: migrations -> base seed -> boot
// auto-import -> operational site — so a disaster-recovery rebuild or any
// interactive restore of a pre-cleanup bundle re-plants the cleaned value
// PERMANENTLY: the one-shot migration has already run and never corrects the
// row again.
//
// THE GUARD
//
// On import (both the boot auto-import and the interactive admin path) the
// site-content planner + applier ask this module whether a bundle row's RAW
// value byte-matches a cleaned literal for that (entity, key, field). When it
// does, the applier SKIPS writing that one field — leaving the cleaned state the
// migration established — and the planner surfaces a named warning row in the
// dry-run. Every OTHER field in the same bundle imports normally, and a club's
// OWN customised value never matches the exact literal, so it is imported
// untouched. The boot auto-import is unattended, so "skip" is the fail-safe
// shape by construction: it cannot re-plant, and it needs no operator decision.
//
// VALUE-SCOPED, NOT ROW-SCOPED — exactly like the migrations. The match is on
// the exact planted bytes, so a club that typed its own hero/footer/address (or
// merely reworded part of the planted one) keeps it byte for byte. This mirrors
// each cleanup migration's own `WHERE "<field>" = '<literal>'` predicate.
//
// The literals below are asserted byte-for-byte against the migrations'
// `migration.sql` by `config-transfer-cleaned-literals.test.ts`, so the registry
// and the migrations can never drift apart silently.
