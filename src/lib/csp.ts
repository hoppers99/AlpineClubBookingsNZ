   * same one the #2420 setup gate uses — and importing the gate here would drag
   * the database-backed setup state into a file every layout imports.
   * `src/proxy.ts` is the only caller that builds a page policy, and
   * `csp-proxy.test.ts` pins the mapping by driving the real proxy over a URL
   * matrix rather than trusting the flag.
   *
   * Its ONE consequence is that Stripe is dropped from `script-src` — the
   * tightening bundled with D1's trade. Stripe.js is loaded only from the member
   * payment surfaces, so allowing it on any public page was surplus reach.
   *
   * **This flag does NOT mean "the nonce handed in is the fixed per-release value",
   * and since the owner's 3 Aug 2026 narrowing that distinction is load-bearing.**
   * The fixed nonce covers only the five approved `(website)` routes
   * (`isFixedNonceWebsitePath()`); the eight `(website-dynamic)` routes —
   * `/hut-leader-instructions`, `/join/[code]`, `/join/verify/[token]`,
   * `/booking-requests`, `/school-bookings` and the three tokenised confirmation
   * pages under the last two — are public-website pages that carry a per-request
   * nonce. The tightening deliberately covers them anyway: following the nonce
   * here would have handed them a LOOSER policy as a side effect of tightening
   * their nonce.
