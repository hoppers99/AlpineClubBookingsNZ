/**
 * The durable, in-row marker that a started approval was RELEASED back to
 * `PENDING`: a `PENDING` request that carries a `reviewedAt` and no
 * `reviewedBy`.
 *
 * ## Why a released request has to be marked at all
 *
 * A release re-opens a decision that had been closed to rejection, on the one
 * path where future bookings may already have been cancelled. Without a marker
 * the row renders as an ordinary **Pending** request: an admin can reject it in
 * good faith, the member is emailed that their request was declined, and their
 * stays are already cancelled with nobody told. The release itself is
 * Full-Admin-gated with a mandatory reason — but the release is not the harmful
 * step, the later rejection is, and a free-text admin note ("blocker won't
 * clear") conveys nothing about bookings. The marker is what carries the fact
 * from the one to the other.
 *
 * ## Why this combination, and not a new column
 *
 * No other writer of this row can produce `PENDING` + `reviewedAt`, so this is a
 * marker and not a heuristic. The complete set of writers is:
 *
 * - the member's own `create` — `PENDING`, both review fields defaulted null;
 * - {@link claimDeletionRequestApproval} — `APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS`, `reviewedBy`
 *   set, `reviewedAt` explicitly null (a claim is ownership, not an outcome);
 * - {@link claimDeletionRequestDecision} — `APPROVED` / `REJECTED`, `reviewedAt`
 *   set;
 * - {@link releaseDeletionRequestApprovalClaim} — `PENDING`, `reviewedBy` null,
 *   `reviewedAt` set. Only this one.
 *
 * `src/lib/__tests__/deletion-request-decision.test.ts` pins that truth table by
 * DERIVING each of the three library writers' rows from the `data` they actually
 * write, rather than restating what they are believed to write; the member's own
 * `create` lives in another module and is pinned there, field for field, by
 * `src/lib/__tests__/phase10b.test.ts`. The release's own real-PostgreSQL race
 * test pins the marker surviving the transition it is written by.
 *
 * This predicate is what every *display* and gate reads. It is deliberately not
 * the authority for the rejection: that is the `reviewedAt` shape inside the
 * rejection's own guarded `updateMany` (see
 * {@link DeletionRequestRejectionOrigin}), because a predicate evaluated over a
 * row read earlier is a check-then-act.
 *
 * The trade-off, stated plainly: it overloads `reviewedAt` on a status that has
 * no reviewer, so the meaning lives here rather than in the schema, and every
 * reader must go through this predicate instead of reading `reviewedAt`
 * directly. In exchange the marker is written by the same single guarded
 * mutation as the transition — it cannot be lost, cannot be forged by an admin
 * typing a note, needs no second query to derive, and needs no migration on a
 * table that predates this defect. A re-claim clears it (`reviewedAt: null`),
 * which is correct: from `APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS` a rejection cannot win at all,
 * and if that claim is released in turn the marker is written again.

 * was authorised against, and the loser gets the ordinary 409 and re-reads the

/**
 * The way OUT of `APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS` without anonymising anybody (#2627).
 *
 * Before this existed the claim was a one-way door: the only exit was a
 * successful anonymisation. A transient failure resumed fine, but a permanent
 * blocker wedged the request forever — and while wedged the member could not
 * lodge a new deletion request and their duplicate could not be merged, because
 * every "is there an outstanding request?" reader treats the state as open.
 *
 * It returns the request to `PENDING` rather than straight to `REJECTED` so the
 * decision itself is still made through the ordinary reject path, with its
 * guard, its audit entry, and its notify choice. `PENDING -> REJECTED` then
 * closes the loop.
 *
 * How this cannot race a finalisation that is already committing: the release is
 * the same guarded `updateMany` protocol as every other transition on this row.
 * A finalisation holds this exact row's write lock from its own guarded update
 * until its anonymisation transaction commits or rolls back, so a release that
 * arrives mid-commit blocks on that lock and only then re-evaluates its
 * `status: APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS` predicate against the committed row — matching
 * zero rows and refusing with {@link DeletionRequestClaimNotHeldError} if the
 * approval won. If the release commits first, the finalisation's own guarded
 * update matches zero rows, raises
 * {@link DeletionRequestDecisionLostError}, and its whole anonymisation
 * transaction rolls back: no anonymisation, no approval receipt. There is no
 * interleaving in which both succeed. Both winner orders are pinned against real
 * PostgreSQL in `adult-member-hosting-queue-merge.realdb.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why this one takes the row lock, and must run in a transaction
 *
 * The release destroys the claim's own attribution, so the audit entry is the
 * only surviving record of who held it and what their note said — and the
 * previous holder must be read from the SAME serialised point as the mutation.
 * Read outside the lock it is an ABA guess: a claim taken, released and re-taken
 * between the read and the write would be recorded against the wrong admin.
 *
 * So the caller passes a transaction client and this function takes the row
 * `FOR UPDATE` first, reads the previous attribution through the Prisma model
 * under that lock (`docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md` -> "Lock raw, read typed"),
 * and only then performs the transition — whose `status` guard is retained, so
 * the protocol above is unchanged and the transition still cannot be lost. The
 * caller writes the audit row inside the same transaction, awaited, so the
 * record and the transition commit or roll back together: neither can survive
 * without the other.
 *
 * Because that lock is the FIRST statement and its counterpart legitimately
 * holds the row for a whole anonymisation transaction, the caller must give the
 * transaction a budget bigger than Prisma's 5 s default and map an exhausted
 * wait to a retry-later rather than a bare 500 — see
 * {@link isDeletionRequestTransactionContention} and the route's release branch.
 *
 * @returns the attribution the transition destroyed, and the `reviewedAt` it
 * stamped — the durable release marker, see {@link deletionApprovalWasReleased}.
