/**
 * AI Diagnostics — the page-context ROUTE REGISTRY (AID-4, epic #2369, #2373).
 *
 * This table is the whole allowlist. A client selector names a `key` in it or is
 * rejected; nothing about a page is accepted from the client except which of
 * these rows it is on, one opaque record id, and tokens this row explicitly
 * permits.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION. Every token allowlist defaults to EMPTY, and an
 * empty allowlist means the field is REFUSED for that route — not "anything
 * goes". Adding a page therefore starts from "no tabs, no steps, no statuses, no
 * error codes, no filters, no record" and widens one field at a time, which is
 * the opposite of the flat Page help string this replaces.
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION (ADR-002). `requiredAreas` is a CONJUNCTION: the caller needs
 * `view` on every listed area, re-read fresh from the database on every
 * resolution. It is never the union, and it may never be weaker than the admin
 * route lattice's own requirement for `pathname` — pinned by
 * `registry.test.ts`, which resolves each `pathname` through
 * `getAdminRouteRequirement` and asserts the lattice's area is present here. It
 * resolves each `steps` token as a SUB-PATH of `pathname` too, because a step that
 * names a sub-page gated on a different area (as `/admin/setup/finance` is) would
 * otherwise pass a guard that only ever looks at the parent path.
 *
 * FILTER KEYS ARE THE PAGE'S REAL QUERY PARAMETERS, and a subset of them: the
 * client must send only allowlisted keys, because rejection is total (`parse.ts`)
 * and one unlisted key costs the operator their whole page context. Pagination and
 * sort keys are deliberately excluded — they say nothing about why a page shows
 * what it shows.
 *
 * The registry is intentionally SMALL. A page belongs here when an operator
 * plausibly asks "why is this page showing me this?", not merely because it
 * exists; every row is a place personal data could be re-read, so each one is a
 * deliberate decision.
