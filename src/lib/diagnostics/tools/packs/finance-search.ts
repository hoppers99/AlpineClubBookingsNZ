/**
 * AI Diagnostics — AID-6C finance pack, part 1: BOUNDED RECORD SELECTION (#2377,
 * epic #2369).
 *
 * TWO ENTRIES, AND THEY ARE THE ONLY WAY INTO THE PACK. Every other finance tool
 * takes an exact record id, so an operator (and the model acting for them) has to
 * FIND the record before any detail is retrievable. That ordering is the shape
 * #2377 asks for — "require selection of a specific record before detailed
 * evidence" — and it is what makes "no bulk extraction" a property of the pack
 * rather than a promise about how it will be used.
 *
 *   diagnostics.finance_payment_search         finance
 *   diagnostics.finance_payment_amount_search  finance
 *
 * PERMISSION: `finance:view`, and only `finance:view`. NOT `support:view` as
 * well — #2375's owner decision is explicit that a domain tool must not demand a
 * support permission merely because it appears inside AI Diagnostics, and a
 * Finance Officer investigating a payment is doing their own job. (The AID-6A
 * audit-CORRELATION entries do require both, because they read the platform's own
 * audit trail, which is a Support & System surface. This pack reads finance
 * tables, which are not.)
 *
 * WHY A SEARCH IS SAFE HERE, stated as the properties rather than the intention.
 * Each is pinned by a test:
 *
 *  - EXACT, NEVER A PATTERN. Every predicate is `=`. There is no `LIKE`, no
 *    `ILIKE`, no `similar to`, no regex operator and no wildcard anywhere in this
 *    module, so there is nothing a `%` or a `_` in a search term could mean even
 *    if the argument schema let one through — which it does not.
 *  - BLANK IS A REJECTION. `EXACT_REFERENCE` requires six characters; the
 *    booking-reference kind requires exactly eight; the record-id kinds require a
 *    cuid shape. `{}` does not parse. There is no "show all", no optional-term
 *    arm, and no default that would list recent payments.
 *  - THE RANGE IS A CLOSED ENUM. The amount search's window is `7d`, `30d` or
 *    `90d` and nothing else, so #2377's ban on an unrestricted date range is a
 *    type rather than a check.
 *  - CAPPED AND DETERMINISTIC. Ten rows, newest first, with the payment id as the
 *    tiebreaker so the ordering is total and identical evidence hashes
 *    identically for the audit trail.
 *  - AMBIGUITY IS REPORTED, NOT RESOLVED. A booking reference is the uppercase
 *    first eight characters of a cuid and is NOT unique, so a search on one can
 *    legitimately match several bookings. The tool returns them all (up to the
 *    cap) and the model is told to make the operator choose; it never picks one.
 *
 * WHAT A SEARCH ROW DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CARRY. No member name, email address,
 * phone number or member id; no booking notes; no Stripe customer or payment
 * method identifier; no free text of any kind except the internet-banking
 * reference, which is bounded to 64 characters and stripped. A search result is
 * for RECOGNISING the right record — the reference, the money, the state and the
 * instant — and a harvested page of them is worth nothing without the per-record
 * tools, which each need their own exact id.
 *
 * THE PLAN, AND WHY IT IS ACCEPTABLE. The reference search's predicate is a
 * disjunction across differently-indexed columns, so PostgreSQL will usually
 * satisfy it with one sequential scan of `Payment` rather than an index scan.
 * That is a deliberate trade: this platform holds at most one `Payment` row per
 * booking, so the relation is in the tens of thousands of rows at club scale and
 * the scan is milliseconds. The 5-second `statement_timeout` is the backstop, and
 * a timeout is reported honestly as `query_failed` rather than as an absence. The
 * alternative — nine separate registry entries, one per reference kind, each with
 * its own index — was rejected as nine tools the model has to choose between for
 * one question.

 *    is the indexed one; `Payment.reference` is not indexed, and is included
 *    anyway because the older internet-banking rows carry it there.
