/**
 * #2649 — the stranded-confirm repair's member notice, pinned at the SENDER.
 *
 * The repair returns a booking to the waitlist after the member's FREE waitlist
 * confirmation was left in PAYMENT_PENDING by a failure in our own code. It
 * originally reused `sendWaitlistOfferExpiredEmail`, whose subject, heading and
 * first line all say the offer EXPIRED — the opposite of what happened (the
 * member confirmed inside the window), and a direct contradiction of the #2648
 * message already sent telling them their confirmation was stuck and not to
 * retry.
 *
 * `sendWaitlistPlaceRestoredEmail` is the true sibling that fixes it, and
 * "sibling" is the property these tests exist to hold: identical plumbing —
 * booking-owner context, template data, optional lodge branding — so the ONLY
 * difference between the two messages is the copy.
