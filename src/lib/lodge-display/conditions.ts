// core built-ins, `<module>:*` are contributed by an optional module, and the

 * `stayStart <= date < stayEnd`, which is the same nights for a contiguous row
 * and fills the gaps of one that is not: a row whose guests are here Friday and
 * Monday but not Saturday claimed the lodge on the Saturday. A departure
 * morning is not a night either way.
 *
 * `nights` is REQUIRED on the payload, so the envelope branch is unreachable
 * from a live serialiser. It is kept because this is the one consumer that
 * would otherwise THROW on a row without it — a lobby TV polling an instance
 * still serving the previous deploy's shape would go blank rather than fall
 * back, and the condition engine takes the whole screen down with it. The two
 * other `nights` consumers (`computeBarSegments`, `staySegmentOn`) already
 * degrade this way.
