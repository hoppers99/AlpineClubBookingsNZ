// Lobby-display terminology — ONE source of truth for the operator-facing
// definitions of the three words the admin uses for two database rows (#2247).
//
// The admin surfaces used "Layout", "Template" and "board" interchangeably and
// defined none of them, so nobody could tell a Template from a Layout. Layout
// and Template are ADR-003 §1
// (`docs/lobby-display/decisions/ADR-003-layout-template-authoring-model.md`)
// restated in operator language. "Board" is NOT in that ADR — it is the word
// the admin and the built-in names grew afterwards, and defining it is this
// module's own contribution (see the decision note below). What the module
// exists for is that the hub cards, the Layouts/Templates pages, the Reference
// page and `docs/guides/display.md` cannot drift apart again.
//
// Decision recorded for "board" (#2247): the word is KEPT, not removed. It is
// the operator-facing word for *what a TV shows* — the thing the Visual builder
// composes and the thing the built-ins are named after ("Everyday board") — and
// it maps onto no single row: a board is a Template rendered on its Layout for
// the lodge its screen is paired to. Defining it once beats renaming ~20 builder
// strings to "template pair", which would read worse and say less.
//
// `oneLiner` is quoted VERBATIM in `docs/guides/display.md` and asserted by
// `display-terminology.test.ts`, so edit the definition here and the guide
// together.
