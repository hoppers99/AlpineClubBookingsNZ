/**
 * Builds the officer-alert payload for a report that has already been stored
 * (#2780).
 *
 * WHY THE ANSWERS ARE RE-READ RATHER THAN PASSED IN. The email must show what is
 * IN the report, not what the request claimed. Reading the stored answer rows
 * means the officer sees exactly the snapshot the admin queue will show them —
 * including the discarded ones being absent, which is the whole point of the
 * question set being authoritative over the submission.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE FROM THE SENDER. Both doors need the identical
 * payload, and the QR door must not be able to shape it differently: the reporter
 * label, the source wording and the photo wording are decided here from stored
 * facts, so an anonymous submitter cannot make the email say "Reported by" a
 * member. The self-declared name on the QR path is rendered by the caller as a
 * clearly-labelled, escaped value and never as an identity.
