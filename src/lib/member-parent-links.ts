 * The FLAT, one-hop reading of "whose email does a dependant of this parent

 * the parent is itself a usable source. NOTHING GUARANTEES THAT ANY MORE: the
 * admin link route used to require an active, non-archived ADULT parent, and
 * #2282 removed the adult half — parentage is recorded at any age. A parent may
 * now be a minor, so this reading is correct only where the caller has already
 * established that the parent can receive mail. Everywhere else — and in every
 * WRITE path without exception — use the async resolver, which applies the full
 * usable-source test.
 *
 * #2716: since inheritance is one hop, a parent who themselves inherits is not a
 * source at all, and the `parent.inheritEmailFromId` branch below survives only
 * as a SELECTION alias — the admin UI shows a mailbox where the parent has one,
 * and {@link matchParentLinkIdForNotification} has to be able to map that back
 * to the parent it came from. It never decides a mailbox.

 * stops receiving anything without anyone noticing.
 *
 * #2716 rewrote the sentence with the rule. It used to offer "no parent OR
 * ANCESTOR in this family has a real email address", which described a walk that
 * no longer happens: inheritance is one hop, so the only member whose address
 * can fix this is the parent themselves. Naming the grandparent as a possible

 * DIRECT-PARENT email inheritance (#2716, owner decision on #2708, 9 Aug 2026).
 *
 * Given the parent an admin chose, this answers "whose mailbox does the
 * dependant's mail go to?" — and the answer is now **that parent or nobody**.
 *
 * It used to be a level-order walk UP the family tree to the nearest ancestor
 * who could receive mail, bounded by the four-generation link cap (#2255, D9).
 * That was an agent-taken decision flagged for the owner, and the owner narrowed
 * it: an address that travels an arbitrary number of hops is unpredictable to
 * the person whose address it is, and a grandparent who supplies an email for
 * one grandchild does not thereby expect notifications for a branch of the
 * family they may have no involvement with. One hop is explainable to a member
 * in a sentence; three is not.
 *
 * THE DEPTH CAP IS UNCHANGED. Four generations still governs how deep family
 * links may run (`member-family-link-depth.ts`); it never governed the address
 * hop, and this function no longer has any reason to consult it — which is why
 * `MAX_PARENT_LINK_CHAIN_LENGTH` is gone from this module rather than merely
 * left unused.
 *
 * THE ACCEPTED COST, which no caller may hide: where the chosen parent has no
 * address of their own, this returns `null` and the dependant inherits NOBODY.
 * Callers either refuse the write with
 * {@link NO_INHERITABLE_EMAIL_SOURCE_MESSAGE} or record the choice and leave the
 * member on the admin "no reachable email address" surface
 * (`unreachableMemberWhere`). A gap somebody can see beats a message going
 * somewhere nobody chose.
 *
 * WHAT IT RETURNS is still a TERMINAL source — a member who does not themselves
 * inherit — so stored inheritance stays FLAT and every reader keeps its single
 * `inheritEmailFrom` join. Terminality is now trivially true rather than
 * carefully arranged: a parent who inherits is not a usable source, so there is
 * nothing left to chain through.

 * A parent link carries no shared-group requirement of its own — the admin link
 * route will record a parent who is in none of the child's groups — so the
 * member family payload was handing every viewer the address of people outside
 * their own family entirely. #2282 widened that further by allowing parentage at
 * any age, so the reachable set stopped being "other adults" and started
 * including children.
 *
 * The rule is enforced HERE, server-side, and never by a client choosing not to
 * render the field: the JSON is the leak, not the screen. The visible shape is
 * built by WHITELIST rather than by deleting `email` from a spread, so a field
 * added to the query later cannot leak by default.
 *
 * The withheld set is EMAIL PLUS THE STATUS FIELDS — `ageTier`, `active` and
 * `canLogin`. Those are facts about a person the viewer has no family
 * relationship with, and `ageTier` in particular says whether a named stranger
 * is a child, which is the same disclosure this issue exists to stop. No
 * member-facing client reads any of the three: the family page renders a parent
 * as name plus the notifications marker
 * (`src/app/(authenticated)/profile/family-group-section.tsx`), and the
 * onboarding wizard does not read parent links at all. So an out-of-group
 * parent yields exactly `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `parentLinkType` and
 * `inheritEmailFromId` — the last stays because the notifications marker is
 * matched on it, and an id pointing at a mailbox owner is not itself a contact
 * detail.
 *
 * The viewer's own groups are the yardstick, not the subject member's: the
 * subject is by construction someone the viewer already shares a group with, and
 * it is the parent hanging off them who may not be.
