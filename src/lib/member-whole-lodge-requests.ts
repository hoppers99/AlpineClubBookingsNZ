/**
 * "My requests" — the member-facing view of their own whole-lodge booking
 * requests (#2263, D3).
 *
 * This module is the ONE place a `BookingRequest` row is reduced to something a
 * member may see, and it exists as a separate module (rather than a mapper
 * buried in the page) so the reduction is testable in isolation and cannot drift
 * per-surface.
 *
 * Two rules it enforces, both privacy rules rather than presentation ones:
 *
 *  1. STRICT ALLOWLIST. The DTO names every field it carries. It never spreads a
 *     request row, so a column added to `BookingRequest` tomorrow cannot arrive
 *     on a member's screen by accident. `declineReason`, `responseMessage`,
 *     conflict data, hold state, admin identities, prices and internal ids are
 *     all absent by construction.
 *
 *  2. VALUE-LEVEL STATUS MAPPING. The member sees exactly one of four words. The
 *     raw pipeline statuses — `PRICED`, `QUOTED`, `QUOTE_SENT`,
 *     `QUERY_PENDING`, `MODIFICATION_REQUESTED` — are an ADMIN-ACTIVITY ORACLE:
 *     "an officer has started pricing your dates" is information about what the
 *     club is doing behind the queue, and on a whole-lodge request it edges
 *     toward information about the calendar. The mapping is exhaustive over the
 *     enum (the `never` check below fails the build if a status is added and not
 *     classified), so a new status cannot default into visibility.
 */
import { BookingRequestStatus } from "@prisma/client";

/**
 * The non-terminal statuses that count against the open-request cap and that a
 * member may withdraw from (owner decision D3, #2263). Deliberately the same
 * list for both, so the cap can never count a row the member has no way to
 * clear.
 *
 * `NEW` is absent because a member request never enters there (it is created
 * already `VERIFIED` — the requester is signed in, so there is nothing to
 * verify); the quote-lifecycle states are present only because the shared
 * pipeline can technically reach them, and the service-layer rejections in
 * booking-request-quotes.ts keep a member-origin row out of all of them.
 *
 * It lives in THIS module, not in booking-request.ts, for one reason: the
 * withdraw affordance (`canWithdraw` below) must be derived from the very list
 * the service's WHERE clause uses, and this module is dependency-free (no
 * prisma, no email) so both the DTO and the service can read it. Deriving the
 * button from a *restatement* of the rule is what let `NEW`/`ACCEPTED` render a
 * Withdraw button the API then answered with a 409.
