/**
 * The pages the public header and mobile drawer link to.
 *
 * Three filters, and the third arrived with the #2352 slice-1 review:
 *
 *  1. `published` — a hidden page is not advertised.
 *  2. A non-empty `menuTitle` — the admin's way of keeping a published page out
 *     of the navigation.
 *  3. The site must actually SERVE the address: either
 *     {@link isCmsServablePageSlug} (the `(website)/[...slug]` catch-all will
 *     render it) or {@link isBuiltInDynamicPageSlug} (a real code-backed
 *     `(website-dynamic)` route renders it).
 *
 * Without the third, slice 1 could leave a nav link pointing at a 404. That
 * slice reserved every first segment belonging to another route group, so an
 * existing row at `/lodge/history` or `/notices/archive` — legal when it was
 * saved — stopped being served. The row is untouched and still `published`, so
 * filters 1 and 2 both passed it and the header kept advertising it, with no
 * signal to the visitor or the operator. An address the site will not serve is
 * not an address the site should link to.
 *
 * This does not repair the row; the operator still has to rename it (see
 * `CONFIGURATION.md` → "Some slugs are refused, and the list grew" for the query
 * that finds them). It stops the site promising a page it cannot deliver in the
 * meantime.
 *
 * ## Why filter 3 grew a second half (#2818)
 *
 * It used to be `isCmsServablePageSlug` alone, and that ASSUMED "the catch-all
 * will serve it" and "the site will serve it" are the same sentence. For an
 * admin-created page they are. `/booking-requests` and `/school-bookings` are the
 * counter-example: a real code-backed route serves each of them, so the link
 * works, while the catch-all must keep refusing the slug because those pages are
 * rendered per request and are never stored. Asking the narrower question would
 * have forced them into the fixed-nonce route group purely to get a menu entry —
 * which is what #2813 first did and what decision 2 of #2818 reversed.
 *
 * Filter 2 is what keeps this OPT-IN. Both pages seed an empty `menuTitle`, so a
 * club that does nothing keeps today's unlisted behaviour (#2421); a club that
 * wants the form advertised types a menu title under Site Appearance & Content →
 * Page Content. The pages' own `generateMetadata` reads the SAME field for the
 * robots tag, so what the nav shows and what a search engine may index can never
 * disagree.

 * decision lists "draft pages" and "unpublished or deleted CMS pages" among the
 * exclusions), and {@link isCmsServablePageSlug} (the address must be one the
 * `(website)/[...slug]` catch-all will actually serve). A page with no `menuTitle`
 * IS included, deliberately: it is unadvertised, not unpublished, and a visitor
 * following a direct link still pays the cold render.
 *
 * **It does NOT take {@link listWebsiteMenuPages}' widened form of that filter,

 * there a link worth offering?"; this asks "is there a STORE entry to warm?".
 * `/booking-requests` and `/school-bookings` have `PageContent` rows and may carry
 * a menu entry, but they are `(website-dynamic)` routes: nothing about them is
 * ever stored, so warming them would fill nothing and the census cross-check would
 * then demand `CRITICAL_PUBLIC_ROUTES` entries for two addresses that must not
 * have any (#2818 decision 4). `isCmsServablePageSlug` alone is exactly right
 * here.
 *
 * Lives in this module rather than in the deploy code because this is where the
 * published filter lives (#2440) and where the contract test keeps it — a second
 * `PageContent` read somewhere else is how one caller ends up serving drafts.
