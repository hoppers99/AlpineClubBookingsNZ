/**
 * Subscription-lockout booking pricing + paid-up-adult presence (#2533).
 *
 * OWNER DECISION (2 Aug 2026), extending the #2364 lapsed-member framing (D-R3)
 * from "not in good standing" to "not paid up":
 *
 *   > A subscription-locked member can still book for others in their family,
 *   > but if that individual's subscription is not paid they get charged
 *   > **non-member rates** (and are **told why** this is the case), and there
 *   > still has to be **at least one paid-up adult member on the booking**.
 *
 * This module is the PURE evaluator for that rule, deliberately mirroring
 * `policies/adult-member-hosting.ts`: it takes already-loaded facts and returns
 * decisions and member-facing sentences. It performs no I/O, so it is
 * deterministic and directly testable, and the decision about WHICH client reads
 * the facts belongs to the booking paths that consume it.
 *
 * THE RELATIONSHIP TO #2364 IS DELIBERATE, NOT INCIDENTAL. #2364 already treats a
 * lapsed member (inactive/cancelled/archived) as a non-member for hosting: they
 * cannot host, and their own nights need hosting. #2533 adds the second half of
 * the same idea on the money axis — a member who is in good standing but whose
 * season subscription is unpaid is, for PRICING, treated as a non-member, and for
 * the "responsible adult present" test does not count as a qualifying adult.
 * `participantQualifiesAsHost` (the #2364 predicate) is REUSED here rather than
 * re-derived, so the standing/adult/operationally-present half can never drift;
 * #2533 only ANDs the subscription-settled fact on top.
 *
 * ENFORCEMENT IS NOW WIRED (#2543), UNDER ONE CLUB SETTING. The club's
 * `MembershipLockoutSettings.mode` picks between three regimes:
 *
 *  - `NO_BLOCK` — no subscription gate at all;
 *  - `HARD_BLOCK` — the historical 403 on the create, confirm-draft, group-join,
 *    guest-add and modify paths. The migration-safe DEFAULT, so no club moved;
 *  - `NON_MEMBER_PRICING` — this module's rule: the unpaid member is repriced,
 *    told why, and the booking must contain a paid-up adult member.
 *
 * This module stays PURE. It decides, it does not enforce: the mode is resolved
 * by `member-subscription-eligibility.ts`, the facts are loaded by
 * `subscription-lockout-facts.ts`, and `subscription-lockout-enforcement.ts` is
 * the one place the five booking write paths call. See
 * `docs/DOMAIN_INVARIANTS.md` → "Subscription-lockout booking pricing (#2533)".

 * in perfect standing, and the plausible response is to pay a subscription they
 * do not owe or to ring the club about a debt that is not theirs.
