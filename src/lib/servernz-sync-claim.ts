/**
 * Single-flight claim for an Other Clubs sync pass.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The nightly cron and the admin Upload/Download buttons drive
 * exactly the same writers. `instrumentation.node.ts` holds an in-process boolean
 * (`isAlpineServerSyncRunning`) which stops one container overlapping itself and
 * nothing else — it cannot see a second container, the HTTP cron route, or an
 * admin pressing a button. `claimBackupRun` (#2095) exists for the same pairing.
 *
 * WHY A STATUS-GUARDED CLAIM RATHER THAN AN ADVISORY LOCK. Both advisory forms
 * are wrong here, and neither wrongness is obvious:
 *
 *  - A SESSION-scoped `pg_advisory_lock` would be taken and released through
 *    Prisma's connection POOL, so the unlock can execute on a different
 *    connection than the lock. The lock then never releases and the sync is
 *    wedged until the pool recycles.
 *  - An XACT-scoped `pg_advisory_xact_lock` releases at COMMIT, so covering the
 *    pass means holding a database transaction open across the central server's
 *    HTTP calls — the thing `docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_LOCKING.md` tells writers not
 *    to do, and with a 10s-per-request timeout it is a long transaction.
 *
 * So this uses the repo's own status-guarded claim instead: a conditional
 * `updateMany` whose `count` IS the claim (`INV-LOCK` is not engaged at all — this
 * writer touches no booking, capacity, settlement, credit or lifecycle state, so
 * it correctly joins neither the global cohort nor a lodge key). A lost claim runs
 * no side effect: the caller returns `null` and makes no request.
 *
 * STALENESS. A container killed mid-pass would otherwise hold the claim forever,
 * so a claim older than the window is reaped by the same guarded update rather
 * than by a sweeper. The window is generous relative to a real pass (two requests,
 * each capped at 10s by the API client) because reaping early is worse than
 * reaping late: two overlapping passes are merely wasteful, whereas a wedged sync
 * is silent.
