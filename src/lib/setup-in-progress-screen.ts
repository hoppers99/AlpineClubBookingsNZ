/**
 * The "Site setup in progress" holding screen, in one place (#2420).
 *
 * Two surfaces render this screen and they must not drift:
 *
 *  1. `src/proxy.ts` — the authoritative one. Until `ClubTheme.completedAt` is
 *     set, the proxy answers EVERY public-website address with `503 Service
 *     Unavailable` and this screen as the body. A response written by the proxy
 *     cannot reach the app's compiled stylesheet (its URL carries a build hash
 *     the proxy has no way to know), so `buildSetupInProgressDocument()` ships a
 *     complete, self-contained document: the club's own theme variables inlined
 *     plus a short inline stylesheet, no external CSS, no images, no scripts.
 *     That is deliberate — the holding screen must render on an install whose
 *     static assets a visitor has never fetched, and it means the "don't 503 the
 *     assets the holding screen needs" constraint is satisfied by needing none.
 *  2. `src/app/(website)/layout.tsx` — the fallback. The gate answers only for a
 *     path `isPublicWebsitePath()` CLAIMS, and asset-extension paths are refused
 *     on purpose — this screen is a document, and a document must never be the
 *     answer to a request for an image — so such a URL that no route serves
 *     reaches the layout directly; the layout keeps its own pre-setup branch so
 *     those cannot see the real site. It renders as normal JSX against the app
 *     stylesheet, so
 *     it looks slightly richer than the proxy's inline-styled copy. Only the
 *     WORDS are shared, via `SETUP_IN_PROGRESS_COPY` below, and
 *     `setup-gate.test.ts` pins that both surfaces carry the same words.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the database or `next/server`, so the layout can import
 * the copy without pulling the proxy's request machinery into a page render.

/**
 * How long a client is told to wait before retrying, in seconds (the

 *
 * The header is set rather than omitted, and the value is deliberate. A bare

 * WITH `Retry-After` as a temporary outage and hold the club's URLs, and a
 * long-running bare 503 as a signal to start dropping them. An uptime monitor
 * gets the same benefit — "not ready yet, ask again shortly" rather than "down".
 *
 * Two minutes because setup completion is a human action on the site-style
 * wizard that flips the state in one save, and because the proxy's own cache of
 * the setup state expires within 15 seconds of that save (see
 * `SETUP_STATE_TTL_MS`). A longer value would leave a crawler waiting on a site
