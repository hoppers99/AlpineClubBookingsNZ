/**
 * Booking-level fragment for "an upward modification delta is still owed on
 * the card additional-payment flow" (#1723 path 2): the payment summary columns
 * track the LATEST ADDITIONAL transaction, and any state other than SUCCEEDED —
 * PENDING, FAILED (abandoned/auto-cancelled), or a null status on legacy rows —
 * means the recorded price increase was never collected. Composed with AND by
 * the bookings-list `additionalOwed` filter so it cannot clobber explicit admin
 * filter choices.
 *
 * `isAdditionalPaymentOwed` (src/lib/additional-payment-chase.ts) is the exact
 * in-memory twin, sharing this status list.
 *
 * The member-facing surfaces use a DIFFERENT, wider list — exactly one status
 * wider — and the difference is deliberate:
 *
 *  - the two surfaces that let a member PAY (the booking-page card and
 *    /api/bookings/[id]/additional-payment-secret) gate on
 *    `ADDITIONAL_PAYABLE_BOOKING_STATUSES`, which is this list plus
 *    PAYMENT_PENDING. PAYMENT_PENDING is missing here only so this queue's count
 *    can be summed with the unpaid-finished-stays count above without counting a
 *    booking twice; the money on such a booking is genuinely collectable, so
 *    hiding the member's own pay button for a counting reason would strand it;
 *  - the member dashboard's owed total is scoped by its own query
 *    (ACTIVE_BOOKING_STATUSES + COMPLETED), which is wider again but likewise
 *    excludes CANCELLED and BUMPED.
 *
 * What all of them agree on is the part that decides whether money can move: a
 * CANCELLED or BUMPED booking is in NO list, member-facing or admin. That is
 * what stops a member being shown — or being able to complete — a payment for a
 * booking the club has stopped counting.
