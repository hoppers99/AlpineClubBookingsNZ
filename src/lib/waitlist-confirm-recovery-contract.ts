/**
 * The waitlist-confirm route's honest end-state contract (#2623 T4/T8).
 *
 * Phase one of a waitlist confirm (`confirmWaitlistOffer`) commits in its own
 * transaction: it nulls `waitlistOfferedAt` / `waitlistOfferExpiresAt` /
 * `waitlistPosition` and moves the booking out of `WAITLIST_OFFERED`. From that
 * commit onwards **the offer no longer exists**, so every later refusal on the
 * request is a refusal against a booking that can never be confirmed again —
 * confirming a second time reads `Booking is not in WAITLIST_OFFERED status`.
 *
 * Before #2623 those refusals answered with retry-shaped copy and no machine
 * flag, and `WaitlistOfferCard` left an enabled "Confirm Booking" mounted, so
 * the member was invited to click an offer that had already been consumed. The
 * flags below are the server saying which of the three end states the booking
 * actually reached, and the card suppresses the CTA on any of them.
 *
 * Consumers must key on `offerRevoked` — not on the error code — because two
 * different sources share `HOSTING_COVERAGE_PARTICIPANT_RETRY`: a *phase-one*
 * participant refusal rolls back with the offer intact (the CTA is correctly
 * still live), while a *phase-two* refusal has already consumed it.
